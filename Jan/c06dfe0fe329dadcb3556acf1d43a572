Asylum policy and climate change are the top concerns for Germans, according to the DeutschlandTrend poll published on Thursday. Nearly a third of all respondents said immigration was the most pressing issue for Germany, marking a 16 percentage point drop. Meanwhile, climate change shot up the list, rising 18 percentage points to 27% of respondents. Climate protests such as the youth-driven Fridays for Futures have prompted greater focus on the man-made destabilization of Earth's climate. Other concerns included education, social injustice and mobility. Security, crime and terrorism were at the bottom of the list with 6 percent of respondents describing them as pressing issues.
