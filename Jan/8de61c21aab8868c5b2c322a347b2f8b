German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer visited German troops in Iraq on Wednesday, as part of talks with high-ranking military officials. The visit comes as Germany is trying to ensure that Bundeswehr soldiers can remain in Iraq. German troops are present in the country as part of a US-led coalition to fight the "Islamic State" (IS), but the Iraqi parliament voted earlier in January to oust all US troops from the country. "We are ready to work together with our allies to further support the people of Iraq in the fight against terror and IS, if the Iraqi government still wants that," Kramp-Karrenbauer tweeted. Around 90 German soldiers remain in Erbil in northern Iraq, where they train local Kurdish soldiers. The semi-autonomous Kurdish government has said it wants German forces to remain.
