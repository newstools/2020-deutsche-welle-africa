Berlin's parliament on Thursday passed a law to freeze rent prices in the rapidly gentrifying city-state for five years, becoming the first federal state in Germany to introduce a rent cap. The new law puts a cap on residential rental prices in the German capital, where the cost of rent has doubled in the last 10 years. The cap is pegged to go into effect mid-February and freeze rent prices until 2025. Following that, the law limits increases to 1.3% per year in line with inflation.

The cap does not include social housing or properties that were built after January 1, 2014.
