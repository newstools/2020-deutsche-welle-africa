Jeremy Rifkin is the author of The Green New Deal, a book in which he outlines his view on the impending collapse of the planet's "fossil fuel civilisation". He spoke to DW Business about the urgent need for governments and societies around the world to take drastic action. "We have now spewed so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to maintain this industrial way of life that we now find ourselves in real time climate change," he said. " We are in the sixth extinction of life on Earth."
