The blast near the Somali parliament comes 11 days after the city was hit with a car bombing, also initiated by al-Shabab, that killed 81 people. Al-Shabab, which has links to the international al-Qaeda terrorism network, has been expanding its influence in the Horn of Africa in recent years.  Read more: Somalia says foreign country behind car bomb attack  The December 28 attack was the deadliest in the country in more than two years.
