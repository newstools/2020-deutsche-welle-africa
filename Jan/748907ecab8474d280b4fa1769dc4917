With the UK expected to leave the EU next week, the EU officials named veteran diplomat Joao Vale de Almeida as the "first Head of the future EU Delegation" in London on Friday. Vale de Almeida is set to take office on February 1, the day after the latest Brexit date. "As of that date, the United Kingdom will be a third country and as a consequence, the representation of the Union will be ensured by an EU Delegation," the EU's diplomatic service said in a press release. The appointment "has been duly notified to the United Kingdom," the officials said.
