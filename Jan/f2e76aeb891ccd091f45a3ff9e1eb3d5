The Sultan of Oman, Qaboos bin Said, died early Saturday at the age of 79, according to Oman state TV and the state news agency. There were concerns about Said's health after he underwent medical treatment in Belgium last month. Some reports claim he had been suffering from cancer.

The sultan was known for his diplomatic skills, as he tried to mediate between the US and Iran. Read more: Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu makes rare visit to Oman Said has no children to succeed him.
