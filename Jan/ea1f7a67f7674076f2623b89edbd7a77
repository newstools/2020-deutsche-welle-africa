Cambodian authorities on Sunday called off the search for victims in the rubble of a seven-story hotel under construction crumbled to the ground in the southern Kep province on Friday afternoon. The final death toll was estimated at 36, with Prime Minister Hun Sen saying that 23 people had been pulled alive from the rubble. "This is yet another tragedy," said Hun Sen, who promised that families of the victims would get $50,000 (€45,000) each in compensation, while those wounded would receive $20,000 (€18,000). The Cambodian leader told reporters that the contractor had died in the building collapse, while the building owners have been detained. The government has formed a committee to carry out an investigation, according to provincial authorities.
