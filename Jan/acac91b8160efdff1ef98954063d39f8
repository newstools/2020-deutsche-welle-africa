A painting found hidden inside an Italian gallery's walls has been confirmed as Austrian painter Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of a Lady," which went missing more than two decades ago. The piece, which was recovered by chance in December in the northern Italian city of Piacenza, was stolen 23 years ago. It was found on December 10 in the courtyard of the Ricci Oddi Modern Art Gallery — the same place where it was stolen in 1997 — while the gallery was undergoing renovation.

"It is with no small emotion that I can tell you the work is authentic," Piacenza Prosecutor Ornella Chicca told reporters at a news conference.

Its disappearance had been one of the art world's biggest mysteries — but questions remain over who took the artwork and if it ever left the gallery's property.
