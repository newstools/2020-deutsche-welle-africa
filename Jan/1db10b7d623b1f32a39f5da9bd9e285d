The suspect is accused of a prolific series of attacks on property between February and April 2018, using a sharp object to scratch 642 different vehicles. The amount of damage caused was estimated to be some 930,000 euros (just over $1 million).

Having glanced out of the window, the witness said she had seen an individual on the other side of the street going from car to car. The woman said he had made the same hand movement as he went from vehicle to vehicle, scratching them as he went along. "It looked as though he was very experienced," she said.
