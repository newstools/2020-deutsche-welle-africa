A leading member of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on Thursday lost parliamentary immunity as federal officials carried out raids on the politician's addresses over accusations of tax evasion.

The case is distinct from an investigation into fellow AfD parliamentarian Alice Weidel, who has come under fire for reportedly accepting illegal party funding. Gauland is a high-profile figure within the AfD's ranks and helped it become the largest opposition party in the Bundestag. Earlier this week, the politician was criticized for purportedly sleeping through a speech delivered before the German parliament by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin following the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. kp/msh (AP, dpa) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
