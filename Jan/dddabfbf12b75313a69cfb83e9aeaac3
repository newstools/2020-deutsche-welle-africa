Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday said that those responsible for shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet must be punished. In a televised speech, the president said it was important that those "at fault or negligent at any level" face justice. "Anyone who should be punished, must be punished," the president said in a televised speech. Rouhani added that the "tragic event" would be subject to a thorough investigation. "The judiciary must form a special court with high-ranking judge and dozens of experts...The whole world will be watching," he said. Collective guilt At the same time, the president acknowledged the accidental and collective nature of the incident, saying it was "an unforgivable error...one person cannot be solely responsible for the plane crash." "Iranian armed forces admitting their mistake is a good first step. We should assure people that it will not happen again," Rouhani said. The president said that his government was "accountable to Iranians and other nations who lost lives in the plane crash."
