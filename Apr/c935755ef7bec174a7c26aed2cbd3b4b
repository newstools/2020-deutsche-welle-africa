German business software giant SAP on Tuesday blamed the coronavirus and the resultant "unprecedented change" to the world economy for Morgan's departure and its decision to retain co-CEO Christian Klein as a solo boss in future. The company said it wanted to return to a more normal, single-person leadership model in unusual times. Last October, Morgan, 48, alongside Klein, 39, had jointly taken over from former CEO Bill McDermott, in line with mounting calls — particularly in Germany — for women's advancement at top managerial level. American businesswoman Morgan's rise to jointly head a German company triggered international headlines and was billed by SAP as the way forward following in the tracks of its co-founder Hasso Plattner. In Tuesday's surprise message, endorsed by Morgan, SAP said it had "become clear that now is the right time for the company to transition to a single CEO leading the business."

Christian Klein has spent his entire career with SAP Reporting its first quarter results, SAP quoted Morgan as saying her time at SAP had been a "great privilege," adding that solo leadership was right, given the pandemic. Despite such upheavals, SAP reported revenues of €6.5 billion ($7 billion) over the first three months, up 7% year-on-year, and net profit at €811 million. After expensive personal restructuring last year, SAP in February began to rearrange its top managerial ranks, reportedly to deal with customer complaints over its slimming-down of its software assortment. Klein, who's been with the company since he was a student, on Tuesday said SAP would maintain its strong focus on cloud computing solutions. ipj/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
