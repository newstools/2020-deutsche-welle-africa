Germany's economy is not expected to recover from the effects of the coronavirus crisis until the end of 2021, the Institute for Economic Research (Ifo), a Munich-based economic think tank, said on Tuesday. Ifo has predicted that the German economy, Europe's largest, will contract by 6.6% overall in 2020. The think tank said it had already diminished by 1.9% in the first quarter of 2020 and is expecting a 12.2% contraction in the three months that follow.

Ifo predicted that all sectors of the economy could see a boost, as lockdowns are gradually eased, from the third quarter and beyond.
