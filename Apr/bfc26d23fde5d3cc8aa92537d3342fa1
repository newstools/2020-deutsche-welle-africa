The benchmark US crude price headed into the negatives after dropping to $.01 on Monday for the first time ever, and then later deep into negative territory, following a day of record declines. The drop comes amid a one-third decrease in demand for fuel, and a global halt to industry, travel and economic activities that normally utilize oil. After beating the record several times, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) continued to sink to a penny per barrel before moving back up to $0.27 (€0.25). Then it dived once again, dipping into negative territory early in the afternoon in the US. The price for May contracts on Monday burned all value, revealing the oversupply in the US oil market. The drop, also due to a lack of storage capacity, could even mean that producers may be forced to pay buyers to get rid of the oil. Sellers of the May contract have just one day left to find buyers for the oil, but are struggling to find those buyers — hence the furious firesale. The WTI contract for June delivery is trading at a still low but less remarkable $22 per barrel. lc/msh (AFP, AP) More to follow...
