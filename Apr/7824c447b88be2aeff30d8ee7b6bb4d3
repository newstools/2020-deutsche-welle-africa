When it comes to happiness, people's dreams and desires are the same all over the world: a steady income, good health and opportunities for personal development. But those who come from poor backgrounds barely have a chance. Inequality begins in childhood. At what point is the course of someoneâ€™s life set? How can disadvantaged people guard against false promises? Who can they turn to for help? We meet three founders of social ventures. They want to overcome the barriers in society and are committed to improving equal opportunities and creating more social justice. Poverty means not only a low income, but above all a lack of opportunities to shape one's own life and advance in society. Many do not succeed in this on their own, but need support.
