A man attacked several people in shops and outside a bakery in the southeastern French town of Romans-sur-Isere on Saturday, killing at least two people. Some reports spoke of seven other people having been wounded, one in critical condition. Witnesses told Reuters news agency that the man appeared to attack people at random while moving about the center of the town, situated south of Lyon. A male suspect has been arrested, according to the mayor of the town, Marie-Helene Thoraval, and media reports. Prosecutors said the man claimed to be Sudanese and to have been born in 1987.
