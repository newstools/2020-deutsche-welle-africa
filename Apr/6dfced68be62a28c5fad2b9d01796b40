He died a few hours later in the hospital. There was a brief calm around sunset, when Muslims broke their fast during the ongoing holy month of Ramadan. But clashes resumed soon after al-Samman's tense funeral. Protesters were seen torching and vandalizing banks and army vehicles. Protesters also attempted to stone the central bank headquarters in the capital, Beirut, late on Tuesday night, before being dispersed by troops.
