Steinmeier also called on individuals to adhere to the measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus. "How things will continue and when and how the restrictions can be relaxed, will not be decided by politicians and experts alone." The crisis had brought out "the best and the worst in people," he said. Nations are not against nations In response to comparisons of efforts to tackle the pandemic to war, Steinmeier called the measures a "test of humanity." "No, this pandemic is not a war.

"We don't want to become an anxious or distrustful society. But we can be a society with more trust, more consideration and more confidence," he said. The German president additionally called for international solidarity across the European Union. "Germany cannot come out of this crisis strong and healthy if our neighbors do not also come out strong and healthy," he said. The speech marked the first time that Steinmeier formally addressed the nation on television, other than at Christmas time. There was no broadcast presidential speech even immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
