On Wednesday, the Royal Papworth Hospital in the city of Cambridge in the UK received a unique donation – the personal ventilator of world-renowned physicist, Stephen Hawking. Hawking's family made the donation to help the hospital fight COVID-19. "After our father passed away, we returned all the medical equipment he used that belonged to the NHS but there were some items which he bought for himself. We are now passing them to the NHS in the hope they will help in the fight against COVID-19," said Lucy Hawking, the daughter of Stephen Hawking. Read more: Coronavirus: How do ventilators work?
