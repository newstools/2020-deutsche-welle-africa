Dutch military police on Saturday arrested two men, one of whom was carrying a loaded firearm, at Schiphol airport train station. Schiphol is the Netherland's main international airport. A train passenger informed emergency services at around 9.45 p.m. (1900 UTC) that someone was loading a firearm on the train. A specialist team were then dispatched to intercept the men at the airport station, reported public broadcaster NOS. The team entered the train with shields and pushed the man and his fellow passenger to the ground, reported NOS. "Then we found the firearm on one of them," said a spokesman for the Marechaussee – the name of the Dutch military police. "The man in possession of a firearm and his traveling companion have been detained for further investigation," said the Marechaussee – the name of the Dutch military police – in a statement. They did not provide any further information. Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism. Sign up to receive it directly here.
