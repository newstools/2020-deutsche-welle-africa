Ryanair's policy of not including surcharges in its initial online prices was deemed unlawful by the EU's top court on Thursday. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) came to the conclusion of wrongdoing after the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) criticized Ryanair in 2011 for prices that did not include value-added tax on domestic flights, as well as additional fees for check-in and transactions made by credit card.

Ryanair took the matter to court, prompting Italy's Council of State to ask the CJEU whether the surcharges needed to be included.
