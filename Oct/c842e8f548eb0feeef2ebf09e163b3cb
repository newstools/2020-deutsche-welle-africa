Four domestic intelligence staff in Germany's western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) are suspected of being involved in far-right activity online, according to a local media report on Thursday. It comes just two weeks after the state discovered five right-wing extremist chat groups among its police, leading to the suspension of 29 officers. Three of the four suspected cases worked for an intelligence observation team, local newspaper Rheinische Post reported, citing the NRW Interior Ministry. Another was an administrative clerk in the police department. They were flagged in social networks and chats for sending videos with "anti-Islam or xenophobic connotations."
