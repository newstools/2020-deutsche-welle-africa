A project by the UK government revealed that traces of COVID-19 can be found in sewage. This can indicate if a local community or institution is experiencing a spike in cases, giving health officials early signs of a local outbreak. The project, which was launched in June, proved that fragments of genetic material from the virus can be detected in waste water. "This is a significant step forward in giving us a clearer idea of infection rates both nationally and locally, particularly in areas where there may be large numbers of people who aren’t showing any symptoms and therefore aren’t seeking tests," British Environment Secretary George Eustice said. The study has been extended to 90 waste water sites in England, and the government aims to expand it further. Switzerland hit a new record of COVID-19 infections, as the country of 8.6 million people now joins some 50 other nations seeing their total cases exceed 100,000. Germany has now added Switzerland to its high-risk list coronavirus hot spots. Total confirmed infections Switzerland rose by 6,634 to 103,653, with the death toll rosing by 10 to 1,877, Swiss health officials said. The federal government in Bern is expected to impose tougher nationwide restrictions next week, even as the country is still aiming to keep businesses open, children in classes and hospitals operating. Testing and tracing capacity is being stretched to the limit, officials said. They are appealing to those who test positive to reach out themselves to inform people with whom they have had contact and to encourage them to enter quarantine. Netherlands, one of the worst-hit European nations worst hit by the second wave of coronavirus began transferring COVID-19 patients to Germany, as the number of patients in its hospitals and in critical care has risen rapidly. The Flevo hospital in the central Dutch town of Almere said it would transfer two of its intensive care patients by helicopter to a hospital in the west German city of Münster, around 65 km (40 miles) east of the Dutch-German border. It was not the first time this year that the Netherlands sent coronavirus patients to Germany. During the first wave in March and April dozens of Dutch patients were transferred to Germany, where the intensive care capacity is significantly larger than in the Netherlands. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the "real number" of coronavirus infections in his country is more than 3 million. Spain officially has just over 1 million cases, but Sanchez said extrapolations from a nationwide antibody study showed the actual figure was far higher. Meanwhile, Madrid's regional government is introducing a ban on households gathering indoors between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. The new measures, to come into effect on Saturday, will also limit capacity inside restaurants, bars, gyms and cinemas to 50%. Poland will close restaurants for two weeks and cap public gatherings at five people from Saturday as part of new regulations to slow the spread of the the coronavirus. The eastern European country recorded more than 13,600 infections on Friday — its highest daily caseload since the pandemic began. Germany has reported more than 11,200 cases for a second day in a row. The number of coronavirus infections has been steadily increasing in the country, with the daily tally crossing the 10,000 mark on Thursday for the first time since the pandemic began. Data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases on Friday showed there were 49 new deaths from the coronavirus, bringing the country's toll to 9,954.

It will affect roughly two in three citizens. Prime Minister Jean Castex announced the new measures on Thursday, saying that the situation continued to "deteriorate." France is reporting the highest seven-day average of new cases in Europe with 25,480 infections per day. The 9 p.m. - 6 a.m. curfew, which had already been imposed in Paris and its suburbs, will now be extended to 38 other regions, and Polynesia. Some 46 million people will have to stay home overnight unless they have a certain reason for going outdoors, such as walking a dog, traveling to and from work or catching a train or flight.

"There are difficult days and weeks ahead, but we will get through this together. People are not on their own. We have an economic plan that will protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people wherever they live and whatever their situation," said the finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak. India has reported fewer than 60,000 new coronavirus cases for a fifth consecutive day, a significant decline from the daily record of 97,000 infections it posted a month ago. India has the second-highest caseload in the world behind the United States, but the number of new daily cases has shown a downward trend in October. The Health Ministry says 54,366 news cases were registered on Friday, taking the overall total past 7.7 million. Read more: Has coronavirus already peaked in India? Experts have warned that the festival season, currently underway in the world's second-most populous country, could lead to a fresh spike. Japan's expert panel to combat the pandemic has proposed extending the New Year's holidays by about a week until January 11. The panel believes companies extending the holiday would help in reducing the rush among travelers returning to their home towns, said Japan's Kyodo news agency. The Australian state of Victoria, which was a COVID-19 hotspot, reported on Friday that active cases had fallen to a four-month low. Only one new infection was recorded in the past 24 hours. "This is a good number. This is a very clear sign that the strategy is working," state premier Daniel Andrews said. The state is expected to announce an easing of restrictions and social distancing measures on Sunday. During the final US presidential debate, President Donald Trump said he took full responsibility for the US response to the pandemic, insisting that he had performed well. "We closed up the greatest economy in the world to fight this disease, which came from China," he said, adding that mortality rates in the US were "down" and that a vaccine "will be delivered in weeks." He said that the US, with the most recorded cases and deaths in the world in gross terms, was now "rounding the turn."

But this does not do justice to the complex reality of how aerosols spread, researchers from Oxford and London (UK) and Cambridge MA (US) have written in an analysis published in the British Medical Journal in late August. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tried to show schoolchildren how it should be done. But what does his gesture mean exactly? Do his fingertips have to be 1.5 meters away from the fingertips of another person? That would be a reasonable interpretation of the regulations. But two arm lengths alone measure 1.5 meters, so distances of 4.5 meters or more could easily result. The Icelandic Association of Sheep Breeders has established its own rules: Two sheep lengths are appropriate to avoid infection. One may wonder if face masks are also supposed to be knitted from real sheep's wool. This young shepherd in Senegal may be trying to find out how long a sheep is by pulling its hind leg. The Icelanders already know — exactly 1 meter. Of course, this could also work. The standard length of a dog leash corresponds pretty exactly to the current coronavirus rules. Could it be a coincidence that a six-foot leash is usually prescribed for places where leashes are compulsory? The authors led by Lydia Bourouiba, an expert in fluid dynamics and disease transmission at MIT, writes that the rule is outdated. Two meters was the distance recommended by the German physician C. Flügge in 1897. Visible droplets that he had caught within this distance were still contagious. A 1948 study showed that 90% of streptococci coughed out in droplets flew no further than 1.7 meters. The 1948 study was published in the American Medical Journal. It also showed that 10% of streptococci flew much further: up to 2.9 meters. If that were the case, perhaps the people on this lawn on the banks of the Rhine in Dusseldorf would be safe — if every other circle remained free. But wait a minute — we are not dealing with streptococci (bacteria) here, but with viruses. Viruses are much smaller than bacteria, so they can float around for hours and spread better in the air. This is why the researchers recommend that the distance between people should not be the only safety criterion but that other factors should be considered, too: How well a room is ventilated, whether people are wearing masks, and whether they are silent, speaking softly or singing and shouting. Numerous studies have also shown that coughing can propel veritable parcels of viruses up to 8 meters through the air. Speaking or singing loudly also spread a lot of aerosols and droplets about the room. If, however, people only speak quietly, as in a library, and sit in the fresh air, safe distances can be smaller again. The duration of a stay in a contaminated room and how many people are in that room are also decisive factors when assessing the risk of infection. The researchers have used those factors to develop a traffic light model. The clear result: In rooms with a high occupancy, you should generally stay only for a short time, make sure they are well aired, wear a mask and speak quietly. Even very brief contact can be enough to transmit SARS-CoV-2. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) had to tighten its rules on October 21, after a prison guard caught SARS-CoV-2 from prisoners with whom he had only had contact with for a few minutes at a time. Now, "close contact" is defined as being within 2 metres of an infected person for at least 15 minutes cumulatively within 24 hours. Here, however, the traffic light of the UK-US research team would show green. Outside, people can be safe for long periods of time even without a mask, provided there are few people around, everything is well ventilated and no one talks much. But even so, will the distance between deck chairs being measured here be enough? Author: Fabian Schmidt tg, nm/msh (AP, Reuters, dpa)
