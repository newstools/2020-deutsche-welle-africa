The EU's top court said on Tuesday that the bloc's data protection rules should prevent authorities from indiscriminately snooping on personal data of internet and phone users. But, spying agencies may briefly hold on to bulk data for a limited time when an EU member state faces "a serious threat," the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said.

"In urgent cases, the review must take place promptly," the Luxembourg-based court said. The ECJ was ruling on whether laws in Britain, France and Belgium allowing spy agencies to indiscriminately collect user metadata are in line with EU privacy rules.
