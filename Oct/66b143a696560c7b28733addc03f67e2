Voters in Ivory Coast are casting their ballots on Saturday in a tense presidential election that has been marred by violence. The country has been in turmoil since President Alassane Ouattara announced in August that he would seek a third term. Over the past few weeks, at least 30 people have been killed in pre-election violence, evoking memories of a 2010-2011 crisis that turned Abidjan into a battleground and left 3,000 dead. Ouattara, 78, was supposed to step aside after his second term to make way for a younger generation, but his chosen successor's sudden death forced a change in plan. The opposition slammed the president's decision to seek a third term, saying it's against the constitution, which allows two terms. But Ouattara and his supporters argue that a 2016 constitutional tweak reset the clock on his term. Four candidates are competing for the highest office. The incumbent's key rivals, Konan Bedie, 86, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, 67, both say Ouattara's third-term bid is unconstitutional and have called for an election boycott and civil disobedience. More than 35,000 police and security force officials have been mobilized to secure the election Roughly 7.5 million Ivorians can cast their vote at more than 22,000 polling stations between 0700 and 1700 GMT.
