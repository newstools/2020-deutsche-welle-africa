European cuisine has a lot to offer, because each country has different culinary influences and boasts a great variety of local dishes. The small southeastern European nation of Slovenia is becoming a gourmet hotspot. It has an eclectic cuisine – a melting pot of rustic, traditional recipes and the growing gourmet scene of recent years. Many of you wrote in this week to tell us your favorite European cuisine. A huge thank you to everyone who took part!  To one of the many participants we’re giving away a rucksack (plus surprise content) in an exclusive DW design. The lucky winner is Ruben Diaz L. from Reno (USA). Their favorite European cuisine is: spanish cuisine.  Congratulations!
