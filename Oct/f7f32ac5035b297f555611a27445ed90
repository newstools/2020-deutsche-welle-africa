The film is called 'Sauti'- which means 'Voice' in English. And all the musicians in the film have had to fight a number of challenges - One is blind, one is an Albino, another was crippled by Polio as a child - and theres also a group of spirited women from Somalia - making music is not something that women are supposed to do in their culture. But, noneÂ of them were not silenced by their circumstances, and they inspire others. Report: Antje Diekhans (presenter: Loveday Wright)
