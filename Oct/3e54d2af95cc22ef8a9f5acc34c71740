The Indian financial hub of Mumbai was hit by a widespread power outage on Monday that halted train services and caused disruptions for millions of people. It was the city's first such blackout in more than two years. The failure was caused by "technical problems" during maintenance work, the energy minister of Mumbai's home state, Maharashtra, said. Power has since been restored to much of the city, officials said.
