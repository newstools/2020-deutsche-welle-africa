Crowds took to the streets again in Nigeria's largest cities on Monday in protest againstÂ police brutality. Rights group Amnesty International said five people had died since the start of the weekend, bringing the death toll to 15 since demonstrations erupted earlier this month. In Lagos, thousands brought the city to a standstill amid an outpouring of anger towards the country's notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). Authorities scrapped the unit a week ago and promised to overhaul the country's police force. A new SWAT unit was set to start training on Monday. In the capital Abuja, security forces fired tear gas at protesters, according to the AFP news agency.
