Giro d'Italia limps on amid coronavirus fears After a number of riders tested positive for COVID-19 and two teams withdrew, doubts are growing as to whether this year's Giro d'Italia can be safely completed. Team EF Pro Cycling have already demanded the race be abandoned, saying that the protective bubble around the teams has been "clearly damaged" and that "further infections" are to be expected. Belgian rider Thomas De Gendt from team Lotto-Soudal said there had already been heated discussions within his team over whether or not to start Friday's 12th stage, adding that he had heard fellow riders coughing in the peloton. "Things aren't going well, we don't feel safe," he said. "In the end, you can't concentrate. I am one of the riders who would prefer not to start." Organizers claim that the eight positive tests registered across five teams earlier this week, including British favorite Simon Yates, are proof that the hygiene concept works, with race director Mauro Vegni accusing individual teams of "carelessness in the bubble." "I think the organizers are hiding things," said De Gendt. "There's a lot of money on the line and it's important for the sponsors that we make it to Milan." Ronaldo's flight home to Italy questioned Italy's sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, says Cristiano Ronaldo may have breached COVID-19 protocol by returning home to Turin despite testing positive for the virus while on international duty. The Juventus forward was ruled out of Portugal's friendly against Sweden in Lisbon and forced into a period of self-isolation. Ronaldo traveled back to Italy on Wednesday evening by private jet. Spadafora told Italian radio he may have broken health rules. "Without authorisation from the health authorities, I think he has violated the protocol," he said. Juventus president Andrea Agnelli said no rules had been broken. "You must call the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of the Interior and have them explain what has been violated," Agnelli said during a news conference. Juventus said on Wednesday that Ronaldo had returned on a medical flight "authorised by the competent health authorities". Hertha's Matteo Guendouzi tests positive for COVID-19 Hertha Berlin midfielder Matteo Guendouzi has tested positive for coronavirus after returning from international duty with the French under-21 team.

Guendouzi, who has joined Hertha on a season-long loan from Arsenal, will be eligible to finally make his debut against Wolfsburg on November 1. German FA hits back over tax evasion accusations A bizarre twist in the German Football Association’s current problems with the tax authorities, with reports suggesting the outstanding fees have already been paid. The DFB has endured a rocky few days after tax authorities raided its headquarters and private apartments as part of a tax fraud investigation last week. The public prosecutor’s office has accused six former or current DFB executives of deliberately submitting incorrect tax declarations relating to advertising revenues in 2014 and 2015, avoiding about €4.7 million ($5.52 million) in taxes. Yet the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reports that the association actually cleared up those tax irregularities in March 2019. The DFB has so far failed to declare whether or not they settled the dispute previously. Ronaldo tests positive for COVID-19 Juventus and Portugal soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a statement by the Portuguese soccer federation (FPF). The statement said that Ronaldo was showing no COVID-19 symptoms and was in isolation, thus missing Wednesday's Nations League match against Sweden. Due to isolation rules, he will also miss Juventus' upcoming games in Serie A and the Champions League. The FPF said that all other Portugal players underwent new coronavirus tests on Tuesday and all returned negative. Golf star Johnson also tests positive World number one golfer Dustin Johnson has withdrawn from this week’s CJ Cup after testing positive for COVID-19. The 36-year-old American reported symptoms to the PGA Tour on the weekend and following a test will now begin to self-isolate. “Obviously, I am very disappointed,” Johnson said. “I was really looking forward to competing this week, but will do everything I can to return as quickly as possible. Rafael Nadal produced a vintage performance on Sunday to remain the king of the clay in Paris. The Spaniard's flawless 6-0, 6-2, 7-5 win over Novak Djokovic brought him his 13th French Open title. Perhaps more significantly though, Nadal's win equalled Roger Federer's record of 20 Grand Slam titles, the last of which the Swiss won at the 2018 Australian Open. "Winning here means everything to me," Nadal said on court straight after his win. "I don't think today about equalling Roger's record of 20 Grand Slams. For me, today is a Roland Garros victory. Roland Garros means everything to me... many of the important moments of my career have been here. The love story I have with this city and this court is unforgettable." The French Open usually starts in late May but was postponed until late September due to the coronavirus pandemic. And Nadal had some words of encouragement for the world's fight against the virus. "I want to send a message to all the people in the world," Nadal said. "We are going through a tough moment with this virus, but everyone stay positive and we will beat it together." Poland's Iga Swiatek has made history. The 19-year-old, who did not drop a set throughout the tournament, beat fourth seed Sofia Kenin 6-4 6-1 to win the 2020 French Open. In doing so, the world number 54, became the first ever Grand Slam singles champion from Poland, the youngest French Open winner since 1992 and the ninth first-time champion in the past 14 Grand Slams. The 2021 Tokyo Marathon has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The organizers said they were "carefully reviewing plans that will adhere to the situation surrounding COVID-19," and that they’ll do everything in their powers to “deliver a safe and secure event." Around 38,000 participants from around the world were to take part. The Tokyo marathon has been postponed Özil not named in Arsenal's Europa League squad Mesut Ozil's ostracization at Arsenal went to a new level Thursday when he was left off the team's Europa League squad list for this season. The 31-year-old Ozil hasn't played for Arsenal since football started in June amid the coronavirus pandemic, leaving his future at the club in question. Asked recently why Ozil _ one of the club's highest-paid players, reportedly at more than $20 million a year, was out of favor, Arteta said: "The team is evolving, you can see the level they are achieving." Mercedes team member tests positive for COVID-19 Formula One champions Mercedes reported on Thursday that a member of their team had tested positive for COVID-19 but a spokesman said drivers Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas were clear. "We can confirm that a team member has tested positive," said a spokesman.

Six times world champion Hamilton leads Bottas in the championship by 44 points after 10 races. Lack of fans factor in 'crazy' football results Wolverhampton Wanderers captain Conor Coady believes the absence of crowds at stadiums is a major factor behind the surprising scorelines seen in the Premier League this season. "Honestly, they are mad, the scorelines," said Coady. "It's a tough one to put your finger on, it really is. You look at it at the start of the season, some teams are ahead of others in terms of fitness, in terms of having a pre-season. "The teams that have been in European competition obviously haven't had that ... so that might play a bit of a factor. I think fans play a big factor... I think we all want them back as soon as possible."

Kvitova clinches semifinal berth at French Open Petra Kvitova returned to the French Open semifinals for the first time in eight years on Wednesday after defeating Germany's Laura Siegemund 6-3, 6-3, describing Roland Garros as her "lucky place."

"After my last match, I was very emotional to be in the quarter-finals. Now I am in the semis. I never imagined this would happen after everything that has happened. This is my lucky place."

US soccer team forfeits match over alleged homophobia San Diego Loyal players walked off the pitch in a second division game against Phoenix Rising after a homophobic comment was allegedly aimed at midfielder Collin Martin, who is openly gay. San Diego, who are managed and owned by former US international Landon Donovan, had already forfeited a match against LA Galaxy's reserves the previous week after midfielder Elijah Martin was the victim of alleged racist abuse. "We went through a really hard incident last week in the LA match," said Donovan, who also made a handful of Bundesliga appearances for Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich. "We made a vow to ourselves, to our community, to our players, to the club, to USL, that we would not stand for bigotry, homophobic slurs, things that don't belong in our game." Despite leading 3-1 at half-time, San Diego thus forfeited a chance of reaching the playoffs. Opponents Phoenix Rising said the alleged perpetrator "vehemently denied" the allegations. Bundesliga clubs criticize international matches Ahead of next week's international break, several Bundesliga club bosses have issued scathing criticism of FIFA and the German Football League (DFL) over the issue of sending their players on international duty in regions considered coronavirus risk areas, resulting in quarantine upon their return. In September, for instance, Hertha Berlin striker Krzysztof Piatek had to quarantine for five days after playing for Poland in Bosnia, and missed Hertha's German Cup defeat to Eintracht Braunschweig. At the time, FIFA had relaxed regulations obliging clubs to release players for internationals in regions considered COVID-19 hot-spots, but no such steps have been taken this time. "We learned in September that we, the clubs, are left high and dry," said Hertha boss Michael Preetz. "We release our players, we pay our players and, in the case of Krzysztof, we were left footing the bill. Ultimately, nobody was prepared to fight our corner. We realized that we can't count on any help from the DFL or FIFA." "For me, it's absurd to send players to risk areas," added Augsburg's Stefan Reuter. "It is FIFA's responsibility either to postpone these matches or guarantee that players don't need to quarantine when they return." Germany face Ukraine in the Nations League in Kiev on October 10, but local authorities in Germany have already stated that players will be exempt from quarantine regulations given the security and isolation measures in place in the Ukrainian capital.
