Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government won a vote of confidence on Wednesday, thereby avoiding a snap election, as the COVID-19 crisis worsens. Members of parliament voted 180-146 against a motion from the Conservatives to create a special committee to probe the government's ethics and pandemic spending.

"Parliament chose to back Canadians rather than political games," Liberal House leader Pablo Rodriguez told reporters. Trudeau's party had won only a minority of seats in the election a year ago, and required the support of other parties to remain in power. Canada will not need to go through another election, as winter arrives and the country braces for a second wave of coronavirus infections. A poll by the research group EKOS showed that more than 70% of Canadians said they did not want a snap election, according to Reuters.

The motion also called for a committee to probe the efficacy of the government's pandemic spending. "Too many Canadians have been left behind in the Trudeau government's slow, confused and issue-plagued COVID-19 pandemic response – and the prime minister is avoiding accountability at all costs," said Conservative leader Erin O'Toole in a news conference. Trudeau has apologized for taking part in a cabinet decision to use the charity, which has since pulled out of the program. tg/rc (AFP, Reuters)
