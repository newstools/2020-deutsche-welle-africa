Belarus put opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on its most-wanted list for alleged calls to overthrow the constitutional order, the Russian interior minister told RIA news on Friday. In accordance with a regional bloc agreement, Tsikhanouskaya later also appeared on Russia's wanted list. The opposition leader fled to neighboring Lithuania shortly after the disputed election in Belarus on August 9. She has since met with European leaders and called for President Alexander Lukashenko to step down. On Tuesday she set a deadline of October 25, threatening nationwide strikes if it was not met.

"Canada will always be on your side," he said after the meeting. Anna Krasulina, a spokeswoman for Tsikhanouskaya, said that the move by Belarus "doesn't surprise anyone. It's clear the regime has no legal ways of retaining power." Tsikhanouskaya stepped forward as the leader of the opposition challenging the president in the last elections after her husband, who had originally intended to take that role, was arrested and charged with taking part in an unauthorized demonstration.
