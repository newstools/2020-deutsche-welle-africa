Polling ended in New Zealand on Saturday evening, with the initial count showing the governing Labour Party of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern with a commanding lead. Labour had garnered 50% of the votes, compared to 26% for the opposition National Party led by conservative leader Judith Collins, with 1.5% of ballots tallied, according to the Electoral Commission. Ardern is seeking another three-year term as the country's leader in an election that was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

In order to form government, it will need at least 61 seats in parliament or enter into a coalition with other parties. The initially tally would give the Labour Party 64 seats in the 120-member parliament. New Zealand law restricts media coverage and political advertising while polls are open. It also does not allow exit polling, so the first results are only released after polls close. Ardern, 40, has received praise for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic and her response to the Christchurch mosque shootings. But Collins, 61, has argued that she is best placed to steer New Zealand through a pandemic-induced recession.
