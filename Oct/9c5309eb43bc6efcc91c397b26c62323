Some 10,000 people marched through the Hungarian capital of Budapest on Friday, expressing their frustration at moves by the government to undermine academic freedom, and in particular over the lack of autonomy for the University of Theater and Film Arts (SZFE). The demonstration, named "For all of our freedom!" by organizers, took place intentionally on October 23 to coincide with the anniversary of Hungary's anti-Soviet uprising in 1956, a student-led revolution designed to fight back against oppression. Speakers on Friday accused Prime Minister Viktor Orban of limiting academic freedom and pushing through an overhaul of SZFE's structure without consulting students or staff. The participants in the protest marched mainly in silence while brandishing placards and banners with slogans such as "Art is free" and "Enough!" On September 1, Orban's ruling Fidesz party withdrew the autonomy from what is Hungary's most significant training center for theater people and filmmakers.
