Spain's Canary Islands saw the largest number of migrant arrivals since a 2006 in the past 48 hours, the Red Cross said on Saturday. Between Thursday and Saturday, 1,015 migrants landed in 485 boats in the seven Spanish islands, a Red Cross spokesman said. They reportedly traveled across the Atlantic in small fishing boats and were met by sea rescue vessels close to the islands. Spain had seen a surge of sea migration in the recent years, but the flow of arrivals had diminished nearly 5.8% between January and September. Arrivals to the Canary Islands, however, have surged by 523.7%, Interior Ministry data shows.
