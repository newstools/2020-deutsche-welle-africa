The German capital's tourism authority has launched a controversial advertisement campaign featuring an elderly woman wearing a face mask and showing the middle finger to those who do not abide coronavirus measures. Above the image of the woman wearing a floral-patterned mask and giving onlookers the finger, the poster reads: "A finger-wag for all those without a mask." Visit Berlin and the Berlin Senate on Tuesday launched the advert, entitled "We obey the corona rules," aiming to prevent further spread of the coronavirus and to highlight the importance of safeguarding the health of the elderly.

Berlin senate member Marcel Luthe said he had made a formal complaint to the police about the advert, saying it incited hatred against people who cannot wear masks such as young children or people who suffer from health complications.

The text specifies "index finger" while the woman is actually raising her middle finger. The tourism authority said the contradiction is deliberate.

Lorenz Maroldt, editor-in-chief of Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper, opposed the ad. "The enforcement of corona regulations somehow didn't really work out in Berlin," he wrote on Twitter. "So the Senate tried to insult the public." mvb/dr (dpa, Reuters)
