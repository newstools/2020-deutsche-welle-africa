Schalke 1-1Â Stuttgart, Veltins Arena (Thiaw 30' - Gonzalez 56' pen.) Six games in and Schalke still haven't won. The draw at home against Stuttgart means it is now 22 league games without a win for Schalke, marking the second-worst run in Bundesliga history (Tasmania Berlin went 31 games without a win in 1965/66). Malick Thiaw's header might have been enough to give Schalke a first-half lead, but it wasn't enough to cover up another poor performance. Make no mistake, Schalke were fortunate to get a point. Stuttgart out shot, out passed and out tackled Schalke. While the host's midfield kept leaving enormous gaps that prompted head coach Manuel Baum to send most of the game shouting "close up the middle" from the sidelines, Wataru Endo, who has won the most challenges in the Bundesliga, was a ball-winning machine for Stuttgart. Baum's instructions were well-intended but they seemed to do little more than just add to Schalke's stress. Passes were overhit, or inexplicably passed out of play. This is a side so bereft of confidence that even poor form has become a conversation of quality. Salif Sane's inexplicable handball gave Stuttgart the equaliser they needed, and a second looked a certainty. Were it not for a defiant performance from Schalke keeper Frederik Ronnow, it surely would have come. For one funny moment, they might have even stolen a victory that would have been a contender for most undeserved win of the season. More to follow...
