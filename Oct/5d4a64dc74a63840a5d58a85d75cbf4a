An initial image showed flames on the mountain, showing an orange blaze about midway up Africa's highest peak, with the Tanzania National Parks service saying that "efforts to extinguish it are still ongoing." Local newspaper The Citizen said communities situated near the peak were trying to put out the flames, but the altitude of the fire made battling the blaze difficult.
