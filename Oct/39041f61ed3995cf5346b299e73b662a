Prosecutors said at least two people were involved in the attack but the motives behind it were not clear. Peniche said it had not been ruled out that Alba Medina became a target for his journalism. As per a tally by Reporters Without Borders, Alba Medina is the sixth journalist to be murdered this year in Mexico — one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists. Governor Corral condemned the "cowardly murder", adding that he had told prosecutors to ensure the killers are punished. "Justice will be done," he wrote on Twitter. dvv/aw (AFP, AP, Reuters)
