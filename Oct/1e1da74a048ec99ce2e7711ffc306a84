SARS was repeatedly accused of corruption, torture and killings. Street protesters demanded an end to the police unit. On social media, the hashtag #EndSARS trended. On Sunday, the government said SARS would be dissolved. And replaced it with a Special Weapons and Tactics team (SWAT). SWAT will "fill the gaps" left by SARS, the government said. Some Nigerians are reacting under the hashtag #EndSWAT. They fear that SWAT is just a new name for SARS. However, in volatile northeastern Nigeria, the public have one the opposite way. They want to protest the dissolution of SARS.
