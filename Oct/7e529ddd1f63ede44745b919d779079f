For Bayern Munich's players, the games are coming thick and fast on all fronts. After a starting the new Bundesliga season less than a month after the Champions League final, a season which has already included two additional Super Cup matches, many Bayern players were also involved for their countries over the extended three-game international break. Now, before the Bundesliga resumes this weekend, plus the Champions League next week, there's the small matter of the first round of the German Cup against fifth-division side Düren on Thursday night - a fixture which was originally postponed due to fixture congestion. With several Bayern regular in Nations League action this week, Hansi Flick is set to name a much changed team against the amateur side from the Rhineland. The non-German contigent of David Alaba, Kingsley Coman, Lucas Hernandez, Robert Lewandowski, Benjamin Pavard and Corentin Tolisso are not in the squad, while Manuel Neuer, Leon Goretzka, Joshua Kimmich and Serge Gnabry are likely to start on the bench after featuring for Germany against Switzerland on Tuesday. Leroy Sané is out with a knee injury. In their place, goalkeeper Alexander Nübel is set to make his first-team debut, as could new right-back Bouna Saar. New arrivals Douglas Costa, Eric-Maxim Choupo Moting and Marc Roca will lead the attack while Thomas Müller, who of course didn't feature for Germany, will look to pull the strings. Otherwise, reserve team youngsters Leon Dajaku, Jamal Musiala, Joshua Zirkzee and Angelo Stiller could also feature. Bayern's reserves won the national third division last season, itself two divisions higher than Düren. Nevertheless, the division five club, who qualified for the German Cup by winning their regional Rhineland Cup last season, do have professional experience in their ranks: 31-year-old Adam Matuschyk made 52 Bundesliga appearances for nearby Cologne between 2009 and 2015.
