North Korea held a massive military parade on Saturday to celebrate the ruling party's 75th anniversary. Leader Kim Jong Un spoke to a large crowd of unmasked soldiers in Pyongyang's Kim II Sung Square in the pre-dawn event that appeared to breach all social distancing norms. "I wish good health to all the people around the world who are fighting the ills of the evil coronavirus," he said in a speech broadcast on state television. He added that "not a single person" in North Korea had contracted COVID-19 since the outbreak of the global pandemic earlier this year.

Earlier in the day, state media reported that North Korean had been lining up to lay flowers at the statues of Kim II Sung and Kim Jong II, the father of the current ruler. Posters across the capital carried the Workers' Party's symbol — a hammer, brush and sickle — with the slogan that read "Best glory to our great party." This year's anniversary comes amid deadlocked nuclear negotiations with the US Trump administration and a tanking economy. Talks have faltered over disagreements on disarmament steps and the removal of sanctions imposed on the North. Kim Jong Un appeared to attend the parade, in images shown on South Korean TV Kim Jong Un warned that his country would ''fully mobilize'' its nuclear force if threatened, though he avoided direct criticism of Washington during the event. The North Korean leader said his country's continuing efforts to develop its nuclear deterrent were necessary for its own defense, adding that his government wasn't targeting any specific country with its military force.
