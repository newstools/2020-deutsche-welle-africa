Egyptian authorities detained a local journalist, allegedly due to the fact that she worked on a story of a man killed during a police raid. Basma Mostafa had arrived in the southern city of Luxor on Saturday. However, she soon lost touch with al-Manassa, the news website she worked for. In a report, her employer said she believed she was being monitored by the police. The al-Manassa network is banned from operating in Egypt, and its website is blocked. Mostafa, a 30-year-old mother of two, had been working on a story about clashes that had broken out after the murder of a local man by police authorities. Al-Manassa confirmed later that she had been interrogated by prosecutors, who had ordered her to remain in custody for 15 days. Mostafa's husband, lawyer Karim Abdel-Rady, said she appeared Sunday at the headquarters of Egypt's state security prosecution in Cairo.
