The city of Essen in the western state of North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) on Sunday joined Germany's list of urban centers to breach a key limit for coronavirus infections, leading authorities to announce a series of strict measures in an effort to contain the disease According to NRW health authorities, the number of infections per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period stood at 57.3. Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel entered talks with the mayors of Germany's 11 largest cities and agreed to toughen restrictions if the number of COVID-19 cases passed the 50-mark. Other cities which have exceeded the key coronavirus threshold includes Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt and Stuttgart. Merkel's chief of staff, Helge Braun, told public broadcaster ARD that Germany must "be a bit stricter in places where infection chains spread mostly, which is parties and, unfortunately, also travel." "We are at the beginning of a second wave and only the politicians' and the population's determination will decide whether or not we can avoid it, or slow it down," he added.
