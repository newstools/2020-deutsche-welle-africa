Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) said Friday it could form a minority government after its coalition partners voted against an animal welfare bill. Senior PiS politician Marek Suski told TVN24 television that defiance by two junior partners had "ended the coalition."

The Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper citing experts said the bill's likely economic impact would be around €1.6 billion ($1.9 billion).
