Mozambique's government and military have condemned the apparent brutal execution of a naked woman by men wearing fatigues, shown in video footage. The video, which has been widely shared on social media, shows the armed men chasing and beating the woman who has been stripped of her clothing. They beat her with sticks and shout at her in Portuguese, accusing her of being a member of the al-Shabab jihadist group. The men then open fire, shooting the woman dead. DW has been unable to verify the authenticity of the footage. The identity of the people in the video remains unknown. The country's defense ministry called for an instant investigation into the "horrifying" images. "The defense and security forces reiterate that they do not agree with any barbaric act that substantiates the violation of human rights," the ministry said in a statement.
