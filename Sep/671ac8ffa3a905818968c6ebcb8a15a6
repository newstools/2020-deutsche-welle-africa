Authorities in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia launched an investigation on Thursday into suspected "negligent homicide" after a ransomware attack crippled a hospital in Düsseldorf. A woman scheduled for life-saving treatment at the Düsseldorf University Clinic on Friday night had to be redirected to a hospital in Wuppertal roughly 60 kilometers (38 miles) away. A ransomware cyberattack had forced emergency services to redirect nearly ambulances bound for the Düsseldorf hospital to other medical facilities. The state Justice Ministry suggested the woman had died as a result of the delay in treatment caused by the ransomware. Observers have suggested that her death is the first caused by a ransomware attack.

Independent cybersecurity and privacy researcher Lukasz Olejnik described a "very serious indirect link" between the attack and the woman's death. "On lethal cyberattacks, there are a lot of uncertainties," said Olejnik in an analysis published last year. "Technically killing with [a] cyber-operation is possible. It would have serious consequences. On the other hand, detection today is not certain."
