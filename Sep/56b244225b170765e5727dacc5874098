Cindy Erazo, 29, had served six years of her 10-year prison sentence for aggravated homicide, issued under El Salvador's strict abortion laws.

She was then taken to hospital where authorities accused her of attempting to abort the fetus. She said she had an involuntary miscarriage, but she was handed a 30-year sentence on charges of having had an abortion. The verdict was later changed to aggravated homicide and the sentence reduced to 10 years. "Cindy's case brought international attention to the horrible reality of the extreme prohibition on abortion in El Salvador and the insidious culture of persecuting innocent women that it perpetuates," said Paula Avila Guillen, executive director of the Center for Women's Equality.
