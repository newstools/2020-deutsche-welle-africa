Three migrants, who have stranded aboard a tanker for over a month, jumped into the Mediterranean Sea on Sunday in an apparent desperate bid to reach the shore. The trio of would-be refugees, part of a group of 27 migrants, threw themselves overboard from the deck of the Etienne. The chemical tanker, owned by Danish shipping giant Maersk, has been stuck off 23 kilometers (17 miles) the coast of Malta for more than a month. "The situation onboard Maersk Etienne escalated further this morning when three migrants jumped overboard," a company spokeswoman said on Sunday.

They rescued the migrants on August 4 at the request of Malta after their fishing boat sank off Libya's coast. But since then, the ship has been refused the right to disembark by several countries. The company repeated its demand for a port and urgent humanitarian assistance so that the passengers "are immediately given the attention and care that they need."

Italy and Malta say that other EU nations should do more to share the burden of helping those people rescued in the Mediterranean. Failing to help those in distress at sea goes against maritime standards. Yet the latest standoff may dissuade other mercantile ships from responding to distress calls in the future, placing captains in an untenable position. jf/mm (AP, AFP, Reuters)
