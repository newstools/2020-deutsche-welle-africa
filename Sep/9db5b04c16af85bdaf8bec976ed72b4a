A fire broke out at a fireworks factory in southern India on Friday, killing six workers and the owner, all women, while critically injuring another two, police confirmed. The tragedy occurred in a village in Tamil Nadu state's Cuddalore district after an explosion in a one-room hall, where the people were at work, district police chief Sree Abhinav said. Police said they were investigating whether the factory was using permitted explosives and other materials. Recent resumption of work The local government in Tamil Nadu has only recently allowed factories to resume work with their full workforce, following coronavirus-related restrictions. As a result of certain lockdown measures implemented because of the pandemic, the fireworks industry missed its peak manufacturing season prior to Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.
