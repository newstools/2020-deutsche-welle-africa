Authorities have charged two officers, and five others have been suspended. "The national police apologize for any violation of the law or ignorance of regulations by any members of the institution," Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said on Friday, apologizing on behalf of the police. In the nights following his death, protesters have taken to the streets to demand justice for Ordonez, leading to clashes with the police. As a result, over 400 people have been injured, including nearly 200 police officers. In Bogota, seven people, including teenagers, have died after being shot on Wednesday. Three people were killed in Soacha that day. Another three others died on Thursday. see/dj (Reuters, AP)
