US tech giant Microsoft said on Thursday that Russian, Chinese and Iranian cyber operations had targeted the electoral campaigns of US President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden. "The activity we are announcing today makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as had been anticipated," said Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president for customer security. Burt referred to allegations that Russian hackers had targeted the 2016 US presidential election. US intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity companies have accused a Russian GRU military intelligence unit dubbed "Fancy Bear" of spearheading 2016 efforts. Microsoft said "Fancy Bear" was also active in the latest attempts to infiltrate both campaigns. "What we've seen is consistent with previous attack patterns that not only target candidates and campaign staffers but also those who they consult on key issues," added Burt.
