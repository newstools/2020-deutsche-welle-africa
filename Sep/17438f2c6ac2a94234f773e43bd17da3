Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden visited the protest-hit city of Kenosha, Wisconsin on Thursday, two days after President Donald Trump's visit earlier Tuesday. He spoke to Jacob Blake and his family, and also addressed a gathering of the community leaders at a local church. The former vice president spoke to Blake, a Black man shot by police last month, over the phone for 15 minutes. The 29-year-old is hospitalized and may be paralyzed from the waist down, according to his lawyers.

With some protests turning violent, Trump has been quick to point out the role of left-wing activists in stoking unrest. However, the president did defend a 17-year-old who opened fire at protesters at a rally in Kenosha, killing two people and wounding another.
