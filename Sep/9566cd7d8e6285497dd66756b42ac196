Thousands of people marched through the streets of Berlin on Sunday to call on Germany to take in more migrants currently being held in Greece, many of who were made homeless after fires ripped through the country’s largest refugee camp. Protesters in the German capital held signs bearing sayings such as "We have a space" and "Leave no one behind." Demonstrators demanded greater action from Germany and said the federal government should not block individual states or municipalities from taking in refugees on their own, an offer that several parties have made.
