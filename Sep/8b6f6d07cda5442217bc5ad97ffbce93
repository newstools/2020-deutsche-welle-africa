Sub-Saharan Africa could be facing up to 500,000 additional AIDS-related deaths due to coronavirus Â - that's according to a warning from the UN Aids agency UNAID. In Uganda, a hike in public transport costs and border closures, have made it very expensive for people to get to pharmacies and hospitals to pick up life-saving drug refills. So far, less than two and half thousand people in the country have tested positive for coronavirus, but social distancing rules and other restrictions remain in place. Reporter: Isabel Nakirya
