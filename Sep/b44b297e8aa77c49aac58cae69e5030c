The German Ministry of Food and Agriculture said on Wednesday that it had found a suspected case of African swine fever (ASF) in the state of Brandenburg. The suspected case in the eastern state involved a wild boar carcass discovered just a few kilometers from Germany's border with Poland, in the Spree-Neisse district in the southern part of Brandenburg, centered around the city of Cottbus. A sample of the wild boar carcass was being taken for laboratory tests at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, the ministry said in a statement.

Earlier this year some 450 pig farms in the western province of Greater Poland Voivodeship (or Wielkopolska in Polish) were placed in lockdown after ASF was discovered at a farm in the region. Wild boars carry the disease — a contagious virus which is usually fatal for pigs — and it often enters the farm pig population via blood carried by boar hunters.
