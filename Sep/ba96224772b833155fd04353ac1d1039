German Agriculture Minister Julia Klöckner has confirmed that authorities found a case of African swine fever (ASF) in the state of Brandenburg. "We are prepared," she said on Thursday. "African swine flu is not dangerous for people." Consuming contaminated meat is also not known to be harmful to humans, Klöckner emphasized. The case in the eastern state involved a wild boar carcass discovered just a few kilometers from the German border with Poland, in the Spree-Neisse district in the southern part of Brandenburg, centered around the city of Cottbus. A sample was taken for laboratory tests at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute.
