Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday appealed to the Senate for a referendum on whether to prosecute five of his predecessors over allegations that include graft. Speaking at his daily press conference, Lopez said that Mexicans should decide whether the five former presidents — Carlos Salinas, Ernesto Zedillo, Vicente Fox, Felipe Calderon and Enrique Pena Nieto — should stand trial. He accused them of presiding over "excessive concentration of wealth, monumental losses to the treasury, privatization of public property and widespread corruption," blaming their neoliberal policies.

"Instead of going to the prosecution with evidence, he asks the crowd whether to convict or pardon innocents, showing a thumb up or down," he wrote on Twitter. "A setback to thousands of years of justice." Mexican law gives the president the right to request a referendum. The Supreme Court then decides whether it is constitutional. Lopez Obrador proposed the referendum be held on June 6, 2021 to coincide with legislative elections.
