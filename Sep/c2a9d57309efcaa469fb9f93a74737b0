Police in the city of Hamburg are looking for a man who assaulted a train operator after he was asked to wear a face mask and display a ticket , authorities said Thursday. The incident took place last week on a regional train from Hamburg to the city of Ahrensburg. The man boarded the train late in the evening without any mouth and nose protection and encountered the female train attendant. He went into the wagon's toilet and emerged with an improvised face covering, when the attendant asked for his ticket. As the train stopped at Hamburg-Tonndorf station, the passenger ran out. But he then came back and reentered the train to punch the attendant in the face. The woman was left bloodied and in need of first aid, as passengers gathered around to help until police arrived at the scene. The suspect fled and allegedly boarded at taxi.
