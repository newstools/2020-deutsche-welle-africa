"The G20 has contributed over $21 billion to support the production, distribution, and access to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines," the statement read. The meeting will be chaired by Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud In a bid to safeguard the global economy from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the G20 countries have also injected $11 trillion (€9.5 trillion). The group has launched a debt suspension initiative for the least developed countries "that would allow beneficiary countries to defer $14 billion in debt payments due this year and use these amounts instead for financing their health systems and social programs," the statement said. dvv/sri (Reuters, dpa)
