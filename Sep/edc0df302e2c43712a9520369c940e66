European cuisine is hugely diverse, with every country boasting its own specialties. Italian and French are among the most internationally renowned cuisines. A little less well-known is Slovenian cuisine, but this small Balkan state is becoming a nation of gourmets. The Michelin Guide even released its first ever edition dedicated entirely to Slovenia. And it’s not just gourmet cuisine that’s on the rise. Traditional delicacies also have pride of place at the table.
