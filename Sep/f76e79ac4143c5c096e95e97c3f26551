Mary Trump, the niece of Donald Trump, filed a lawsuit against her uncle on Thursday, accusing the US president and other family members of cheating her out of tens of millions of dollars from an inheritance following the death of her father in the 1980s. The complaint against President Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, and the estate of his brother Robert Trump, who died on August 15 this year, accused the defendants of "rampant fraud" and civil conspiracy. She alleges that Donald Trump, Maryanne and their late brother Robert, took control of the real estate empire of their father Fred, who died in 1981 aged 42 after a struggle with alcoholism, and "exploited it to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone around them." Mary Trump says the family members portrayed themselves as her protectors while secretly siphoning off her stake in the family's real estate holdings.
