Korean band BTS became the first K-pop act to top the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in the United States on Monday, with the release of "Dynamite," the group's first all-English single. Within the first week of its release, "Dynamite" had hit 33.9 million US streams with 300,000 units sold. In terms of digital sales, BTS had the biggest week in close to three years, with the last one being Taylor Swift's "Look What You Made Me Do" track in September 2017. The Billboard Hot 100 chart ranks top hits on the basis of US streaming, radio airplay and digital sales data. The seven-member group — with members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook — debuted in 2013, bringing the Korean "Hallyu" wave of music, pop culture and entertainment to global platforms. This is not BTS' first time on Billboard charts. In March, the group's single "On" reached the fourth spot. Three BTS albums have also hit the top spot on Billboard's album charts.
