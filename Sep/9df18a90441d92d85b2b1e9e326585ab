At least three people drowned and 56 were rescued when a migrant boat capsized due to heavy winds off the island of Crete late on Monday, the Greek coast guard said. Those dead included one woman and two children. The bodies were found 12 nautical miles (22 kilometers, 14 miles) off the island's eastern coast. One of the boat's passengers had made an emergency call for help when the vessel was being hit by winds of up to 61 kilometers per hour.
