A Texas boat parade to support US President Donald Trump's re-election ended with several vessels sinking on a lake after they struggled to navigate through choppy waters. Authorities said there were no reports of any injuries or medical emergencies on Lake Travis, located northwest of the state capital, Austin. Images published by US media showed several boats flying Trump campaign flags moving closely together. Travis Country Sheriff's Office, whose deputies patrol the lake, said they responded to "multiple calls" from vessels in distress and that "several boats did sink." "We had an exceptional number of boats on the lake today," sheriff office spokeswoman Kristen Dark told the Associated Press. "When they all started moving at once it generated wakes."
