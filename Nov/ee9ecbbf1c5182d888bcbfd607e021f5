German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the heads of the country's 16 states failed to agree on new lockdown measures following a summit via video conference Monday. They will meet again next Wednesday to discuss concrete measures. According to Merkel, state premiers didn't want to see a tightening of restrictions before next week. Merkel admitted that case numbers in Germany "were stabilizing, but too slowly" to justify lifting restrictions. Germany confirmed 10,824 new infections Monday, when figures are usually lower as fewer tests are carried out at the weekend. A peak was reached on Friday with 23,542 new reported cases. All people considered vulnerable will be eligible once a week for one heavy duty respirator mask, also known as FFP2. Merkel wanted stricter rules on households meeting but talks resulted in appeals to citizens to reduce social contacts after pressure from states.
