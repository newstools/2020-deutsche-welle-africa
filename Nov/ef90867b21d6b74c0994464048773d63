Gunmen in western Ethiopia have killed at least 34 people in an attack on a bus, the national human rights body said Sunday. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said the number of people killed was likely to rise after what it called a "gruesome" attack on the passenger bus in the Benishangul-Gumuz region on Saturday. The EHRC also said that "there are reports of similar attacks" in three other areas, including on people "who have fled to seek shelter." "The latest attack is a grim addition to the human cost which we bear collectively," Daniel Bekele, commission head, said in a statement. Fears are growing of a security vacuum in the country amid a military campaign in the northern Tigray region. Similar attacks occurred in the same region in the past few months. An attack in October left 12 people dead and 15 were killed there in September.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed held neighboring Sudan responsible for training those who carried out the earlier attacks. There was no known connection between the attacks in Benishangul-Gumuz and the recent violence that broke out between the central Ethiopian government and Tigray fighters. The 12-day-old conflict in Tigray had already led to concerns that the ethnic conflict may spill over into other parts of the region. More to come...
