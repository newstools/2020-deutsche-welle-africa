A major police operation and possible hostage situation was underway in Montreal on Friday, at offices of video game company Ubisoft. "There is an ongoing police operation at the corner of Saint-Laurent and St-Viateur. We ask people to avoid the area," the Montreal police department's official Twitter account said on Friday afternoon, adding that they are "currently validating information and more details will follow." Police later began evacuating the building and asked people to stay away. "No threat has been identified for now. We are currently evacuating the building," Montreal police tweeted. Officers were sent to the location after a 911 emergency call, and no injuries have been reported. "We are aware of the situation and we are working closely with Montreal authorities," Ubisoft spokeswoman Heather Steele said in an email to Reuters.
