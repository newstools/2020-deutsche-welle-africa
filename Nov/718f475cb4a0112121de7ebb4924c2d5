Until recently, these communities had no electricity. Residents never had radio and television around Achada Lagoa and Lagoa. Now, a public solar power generation project provides energy for 15 families. Photovoltaic kits generate power. The residents used to travel for miles to recharge their mobile phones. That is no longer necessary.
