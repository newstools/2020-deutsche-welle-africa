COVID-19 has worsened unemployment in Cape Verde. Sonia Tavares and Nadia da Cruz suffered from the economic impact of pandemic. The cousins created a profitable business from a hobby. They now grow and sell ornamental plants. Eliane Carvalho also invested in the plant business, but in another way. After the engineer lost her job in energy production, she inaugurated the "Plantarte" project. Now, Carvalho sells pots in the capital Praia. The pots cost between 6 Euros and 40 Euros. Carvalho wants to keep "Plantarte" as a family business.
