The pink diamond was sold to a telephone bidder, who chose to remain anonymous. In recent years, naturally colored diamonds have been highly coveted by the world's richest. Unlike white diamonds, these stones possess a specific lattice structure that refracts light to produce the effect of color. Earlier this month, western Australia’s Argyle mine, which accounted for the world's largest supply of pink diamonds, stopped production due to depletion. This gem cut from the largest pink crystal found in Russia and was mined in July 2017 by Russian diamond producer Alrosa. It was shown in Taipei, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
