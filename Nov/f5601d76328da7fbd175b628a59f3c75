Four students have been charged over the killing of a Paris teacher last month, French media reported on Thursday. In October, an Islamist terrorist murdered Samuel Paty and removed his head after the teacher showed his students cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad taken from the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine. Three of the suspects were reportedly accused of "complicity in a terrorist murder" by allegedly pointing Paty out to the killer. The three students are aged between 13 and 14 years old, French news agency AFP reported. The fourth suspect is the daughter of the man who led an online campaign against the teacher, AFP reported. She has reportedly been charged with "slanderous denunciation" of Paty for relating her story of the civics lesson despite not attending the class.
