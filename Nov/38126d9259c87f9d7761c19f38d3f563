The doctor was employed at the Essen University Hospital Only in one case, said Essen police, had the accused stated that he wanted to end the further suffering of the patient and his relatives. Both patients had been in "very critical conditions" in the doctor's ward. The tabloid newspaper Bild described them as suffering from the coronavirus and hospitalized in a ward treating COVID-19 patients. Prosecutors said, however, they could not provide more details on treatments the patients received because the investigation was ongoing. Seriously ill patients in Germany can request help in ending their lives under a court ruling issued last year, but it was unclear if this had happened in the doctor's case and there are several steps required before such assistance can be provided.
