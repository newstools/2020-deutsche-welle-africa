Indian police confirmed on Sunday that a top militant commander was killed by security forces in Indian-administered Kashmir. Saifullah Mir was commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, the oldest and largest militant group operating in the Kashmir region. He was killed in a gun battle, Indian police said. "It is a major success for the security forces' fight against militancy in the region," Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar said. Mir had succeeded Riyaz Naikoo as commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen in May, after Nikoo died in a gun battle with Indian security forces.

During the search, the members of the security forces were fired upon, which prompted them to retaliate, as a major gun battle that involved Mir unfolded. His death takes the number of militants killed in the Muslim-majority region so far this year by Indian troops to 190, Kumar confirmed.
