Germany's football association (the DFB) condemned the destruction of life-sized Plexiglas figures in Bochum that depicted famous German-Jewish athletes. The statues were part of the exhibition "Between Success and Persecution – Jewish Stars in German Sports up to 1933, and beyond." The rotating exhibition, which is partially operated by the DFB Cultural Foundation, had been on display since October 8 and was dismantled on Tuesday. During the night from Monday to Tuesday, unidentified vandals destroyed the Plexiglas figures of athlete Lilli Hennoch and Olympic champion gymnasts and cousins Alfred and Gustav Felix Flatow. The attack occurred as Germany commemorated the victims of the Nazis' November 9, 1938 pogrom, better known in English either as Kristallnacht or "the Night of Broken Glass." Anti-Semitic mobs, led by SA paramilitaries, went on rampages throughout Nazi Germany. Synagogues like this one in the eastern city of Chemnitz and other Jewish-owned property were destroyed, and Jews were subject to public humiliation and arrested. According to official records, at least 91 Jews were killed — though the real death toll was likely much higher. The street violence against German Jews is known by a variety of names. Berliners called it Kristallnacht, from which the English "Night of Broken Glass" is derived. It recalls the shards of shattered glass from the windows of synagogues, homes and Jewish-owned businesses. Nowadays, in German, it's also common to speak of the "pogrom night" or the "November pogroms." The event that provided the excuse for the violence was the murder of German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan, a 17-year-old Polish Jew. Vom Rath was shot at close range at the German Embassy in Paris on November 7, and died days later. Grynszpan wasn't executed for the crime; no one knows whether he survived the Third Reich or died in a concentration camp. After vom Rath's death, Adolf Hitler gave Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels permission to launch the pogrom. Violence had already broken out in some places, and Goebbels gave a speech indicating the Nazis would not quash any "spontaneous" protests against the Jews. The SS were instructed to allow "only such measures as do not entail any danger to German lives and property." No — that was just the official Nazi party line, but no one believed it. Constant references to "operations" and "measures" in Nazi documents clearly indicate the violence was planned ahead of time. It's unclear what ordinary Germans thought of the mayhem. There is evidence of popular disapproval, but the fact that the couple in the left of this picture appear to be laughing also speaks volumes. In line with their racist ideology, the Nazis wanted to intimidate Jews into voluntarily leaving Germany. To this end, Jews were often paraded through the streets and humiliated, as seen in this image. Their persecutors were also motivated by economic interests. Jews fleeing the Third Reich were charged extortionate "emigration levies," and their property was often confiscated. After the widespread violence German Jews were under no illusions about Nazi intentions, and those who could left the country. But such naked aggression played badly in the foreign press and offended many Germans' desire for order. Later, further anti-Jewish measures took more bureaucratic forms, such as the requirement that Jews wear a visible yellow Star of David stitched to their clothing. After the pogroms, the Nazi leadership instituted a whole raft of anti-Jewish measures, including a levy to help pay for the damage of November 9-10, 1938. The second-most powerful man in the Third Reich at the time, Hermann Göring, famously remarked: "I would not want to be a Jew in Germany." In 1938, the beginning of what became known as the Holocaust was still two years away. But there is an obvious line of continuity from the pogrom to the mass murder of European Jews, in which the Nazi leadership would continue to develop and intensify their anti-Semitic hatred. In the words of one contemporary historian, the pogrom was a "prelude to genocide." Author: Jefferson Chase "We are horrified and ashamed of the news of the deliberate destruction of several figures in the exhibition," said DFB Cultural Foundation chairman Göttrick Wewer. He said the timing and nature of the vandalism suggested an anti-Semitic motive. The Flatow cousins' display had already been smeared with anti-Semitic slogans in previous weeks. The figure depicting Walther Bensemann, one of the founders of the DFB, had also been damaged earlier. The outdoor exhibition, which portrays the life and suffering of German-Jewish athletes, has toured Germany since 2015. Bochum was the 17th stop of the nationwide tour. "The malicious destruction of the figures in this important exhibition leaves us stunned," Bochum Mayor Thomas Eiskirch was quoted as saying by the DFB. "Bochum was and will remain a cosmopolitan and tolerant city in which the culture of remembrance always has a place.
