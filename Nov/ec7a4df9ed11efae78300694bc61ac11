US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will meet negotiators from both the Afghan government and the Taliban during his visit to Qatar’s capital, Doha, on Saturday. This comes as President Donald Trump’s administration looks to speed up the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan during the last days of his presidential term, which ends with President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20.

While the Taliban have welcomed this news, NATO allies believe that a hasty exit could hinder the peace process. Biden, in a rare point of agreement, also advocates winding down the Afghanistan war although analysts believe he will not be as wedded to a quick timetable. Peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government were expected to start in March after the US and the group signed a landmark agreement in Qatar, the Taliban's base for diplomacy, on February 29.

Pompeo is currently on a tour of seven countries in Europe and the Middle East. He is also scheduled to see the Gulf state's ruler, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, and the foreign minister in Doha. In the past six months, the Taliban carried out 53 suicide attacks and 1,250 explosions that left 1,210 civilians dead and 2,500 wounded, interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said this week. see/mm (AFP, dpa)
