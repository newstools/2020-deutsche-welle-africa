Syria is set to vote on Sunday to elect a new parliament, as the country grapples with international sanctions and a crumbling economy. These are the third parliamentary polls in the war-torn country since the pro-democracy uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Official figures report that some 2,100 candidates are contesting for the parliament's 250 seats in all the 15 multi-seat constituencies. The vote, which has been delayed twice since April, will be held in government-controlled areas and also in areas where Damascus has partial control. These include areas in the provinces of al-Hasakah, Idlib and al-Raqqa. Read more: Was 'IS' trying to sell â‚¬1 billion worth of drugs in Europe?
