The Ukrainian military on Monday accused pro-Moscow rebels of violating a fragile ceasefire in eastern Ukraine just moments after it began. The charge was swiftly denied by the rebels. Under the new ceasefire, which was agreed to last week and came into force at midnight, the use of all weapons is prohibited. The commander of Ukraine's joint forces, Volodymyr Kravchenko, told journalists that despite shelling with small arms and machine guns from the separatists, "our units continue to keep silent." He said the shooting had taken place near the towns of Uzhvika and Novomikhailovka, south of the rebel stronghold Donetsk, during the morning. Representatives of the rebels in Donetsk rejected the claim, describing it as "yet another act of information provocation by the Ukrainian side, aimed at destabilizing the situation." They added they were "strictly following the commitments" under the ceasefire.
