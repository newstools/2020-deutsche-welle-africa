A number of major Twitter accounts, including those of billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk, as well as Silicon Valley giants Apple and Uber, were hacked on Wednesday, as part of an apparent scam to dupe social media users into making bitcoin donations. Twitter posts, which have since been deleted, were fired off from an array of high profile accounts telling users of the social media platform they had 30 minutes to send $1,000 (€876) in bitcoin donations in order to double their money. "This is a SCAM, DO NOT participate!" Gemini cryptocurrency exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss tweeted from his official account. "This is the same attack/takeover that other major crypto twitter accounts are experiencing. Be vigilant!" The accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos and Mike Bloomberg were among those who made the bogus posts, all from their verified profiles. Many of the tweets were quickly deleted. Twitter blocks some verified accounts from tweeting Twitter has, for the time being at least, blocked some verified high-profile accounts from posting altogether. The social media giant did not offer clarification but said in a statement that users "may be unable to tweet or reset your password while we review and address this incident." Twitter added that it is "investigating and taking steps to fix it. We will update everyone shortly." Verified accounts are normally reserved for those in political positions of power or for people who are in public demand, such as celebrities, journalists, and news agencies, as well as governments, politicians, heads of state, and emergency services. jsi/dr (Reuters, dpa, AFP)
