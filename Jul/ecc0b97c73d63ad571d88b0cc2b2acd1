Lewis Hamilton demonstrated why he's the king in the rain, keeping his composure on a drenched track to take pole position for Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix. It was the Mercedes driver's record-extending 89th career pole. Hamilton first beat Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's early time and then his own leading mark on his final lap to finish 1.216 seconds ahead of the Red Bull. Carlos Sainz grabbed third as Hamilton's Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas could only qualify in fourth place after taking pole position and winning last Sunday's Austrian GP. It was another tough day for Ferrari, with Sebastian Vettel 10th and Charles Leclerc 11th. Current standings  1. Bottas (Mercedes) — 25 points 2. Leclerc (Ferrari) — 18 points 3. Norris (McLaren) — 16 points 4. Hamilton (Mercdes) — 12 points 5. Sainz (McLaren) — 10 points Quote of the day "The main problem was that we weren't quick enough." — Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
