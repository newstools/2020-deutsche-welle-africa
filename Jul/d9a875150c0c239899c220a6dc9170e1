A Kansas county Republican Party chairman apologized on Sunday after the newspaper he owns posted a cartoon on its Facebook page that likened being ordered to wear a mask to the treatment of Jewish people meted out by the Nazis during the Holocaust. The owner and publisher of The Anderson County Review, Dane Hicks, said in a statement posted on Facebook that he was taking down the image following "some heartfelt and educational conversations with Jewish leaders in the US and abroad." The weekly paper posted the cartoon on Friday, and it drew dozens of critical responses, as well as worldwide focus. To make matters worse, Hicks then posted a blog on Saturday, defending the cartoon. The blog also attracted criticism, with the public disappointed in its lack of contrition. Democratic Kansas Governor Laura Kelly called for the cartoon to be taken down. She and a number of other critics described it as anti-Semitic.
