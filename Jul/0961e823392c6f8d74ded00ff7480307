A high-speed train collided with a maintenance machine in central Portugal on Friday, killing at least two people and injuring at least 35, the country's national relief operations authority CNOS said. At least seven people were seriously injured, including the train's conductor. Over 200 passengers were on board the Alfa Pendular — the country's fastest train — when it crashed, a CNOS spokesman told news agency Reuters. The Alfa Pendular connects all major cities in Portugal and can reach speeds of up to 220 kilometers (137 miles) per hour. Two medical helicopters and over 160 rescue personnel were on the scene, he added.

But he did not rule anything out. "We have to wait before we make conclusion," Santos added.
