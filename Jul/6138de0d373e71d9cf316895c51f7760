Peter Liese, German CDU Member of the European Parliament (MEP), spoke to DW to explain why he supports a European Parliament move to introduce compulsory licensing of the COVID-19 antiviral drug remdesivir in the EU. The drug is made by US drugmaker Gilead, but compulsory licensing would mean that the medication would be produced by others against the will of Gilead.
