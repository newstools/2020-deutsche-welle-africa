Latest moves Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Germany's transfer window was open for one day on July 1. It will reopen between July 15 and October 5. Here are the latest deals from the Bundesliga. July 18 Rumor: Niko Kovac to AS Monaco According to reports in France, former Bayern Munich and Eintracht Frankfurt coach Niko Kovac is poised to take over at Ligue 1 side Monaco. The Berlin-born Croatian has been out of work since being sacked by Bayern in November, despite winning a league and cup double with the Bavarians in 2019. He had reportedly been on Hertha Berlin's radar too but now looks set to begin a new chapter in the French principality. July 17 Retired: Andre Schürrle German World Cup winner André Schürrle has announced his retirement from football at the age of just 29. The attacking midfielder made 207 Bundesliga appearances during spells with Mainz, Bayer Leverkusen, Wolfsburg and Borussia Dortmund, winning two German Cups, although he also won the English Premier League with Chelsea. However, he is mostly remembered for his cross which set up Mario Götze's winning goal for Germany in the 2014 World Cup final against Argentina in Brazil, a moment which ultimately turned out to be the zenith of a difficult career which petered out with loan spells at Fulham and Spartak Moscow. Speaking to German magazine Der Spiegel about his decision, Schürrle revealed how football made him "rich but lonely" as "the low points got ever lower and the high points ever fewer." July 16 Rumor: Jude Bellingham – Birmingham City to Borussia Dortmund One of the worst kept transfer secrets of 2020 looks set to be officially revealed, with young English prospect Jude Bellingham, 17, reportedly in Dortmund in order to sign a deal with the Bundesliga outfit. Bellingham, a central midfielder, just needs to add his signature to complete the €23 million deal, according to numerous outlets in England and Germany. The move has echoes of Dortmund's signing of Jadon Sancho, from Manchester City in 2017, though Bellingham has already racked up more than 40 senior appearances. July 15 Done deal: Noel Niemann - 1860 Munich to Arminia Bielefeld Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld have signed forward Noel Niemann from 1860 Munich on a free transfer. The 20-year-old made 13 appearances for the third-division side last season, scoring two goals and contributing two assists. July 14 Rumor: David Alaba – Bayern Munich to Manchester City After having their Champions League ban overturned, Manchester City are back in the transfer market – and Pep Guardiola is on the hunt for defensive reinforcements. According to The Guardian, Bayern Munich’s David Alaba is his number one choice. The Austrian international only has one year left on his contract with the German champions, and coach Hansi Flick has insisted he wants him to stay. July 13 Rumor: Milot Rashica - Werder Bremen to RB Leipzig RB Leipzig have had an initial bid for Werder Bremen forward Milot Rashica turned down, according to BILD. The Red Bull side reportedly offered €15 million rising to €18 million with add-ons but the Northerners are holding out for €25 million for the 24-year-old Kosovan international who has scored 24 goals in 74 appearances for Bremen. July 12 Rumor: Weston McKennie  — Schalke to the Premier League According to Sky Sports in Germany, Schalke and US international midfielder Weston McKennie wants to leave the club and move to the Premier League. Schalke would apparently not stand in his way, but would expect a fee of somewhere between €20 and €30 million for the midfielder. Rumor: Kai Havertz — Leverkusen to Chelsea While Kai Havertz is keen to leave Leverkusen this summer, his destination is less obvious. Chelsea might be the team currently in the headlines but after their loss to Sheffield United the race for the top four is back on in the Premier League. It's clear whoever wants Kai Havertz has to be in the Champions League next season. July 11 Rumor: Milot Rashica — Werder Bremen to RB Leipzig Werder Bremen's sporting director Frank Baumann has said that Rashica is in talks with a club but that others are also interested. "We have to assume he won't be playing for us next season." Rashica reportedly has a release clause of €35 million.

Done deal: Sebastian Griesbeck — Heidenheim to Union Berlin The veteran midfielder has signed on with Union Berlin after helping Heidenheim attain third place in the second division, their highest ever finish in club history. July 6 Rumor: Thiago Alcantara — Bayern Munich to Liverpool Liverpool are emerging as strong favorites to sign Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara, who seems set to leave the German champions this year. The Premier League side are reported to have tabled a bid of €30 millio with some outlets already reporting that the Spaniard has agreed personal terms with the English champions. When Liverpool coach Jürgen Klopp was asked about the speculation, he replied: "Would you be surprise if I don't give an answer on that? Thiago is a good player, I like a lot of other players out there, but that's all I have to say." Rumor: Benjamin Henrichs — Monaco to RB Leipzig German defender Benjamin Henrichs is edging closer to a loan move to Julian Nagelsmann's RB Leipzig. The 23-year-old departed Bayer Leverkusen for Monaco last year, but Leipzig are keen to bring him home. July 5 Rumor: Kai Havertz — Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea A transfer saga is brewing. Following Bayern Chairperson Karl-Heinz Rummenigge's comments (see July 4), the English press stoked the fires of the rumors linking Havertz’s to Chelsea. However, former Leverkusen head coach Rainer Calmund thinks differently: "From those around him, it’s clear that Spain is his dream destination." Read more: What next for Kai Havertz? Before the coronavirus pandemic, Kai Havertz was expected to fetch north of €100 million ($109 million). Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich had all expressed interest. Now? Bayern have taken themselves out of the running this year, and Leverkusen have maintained that they will not accept any "coronavirus discount" for their young star. It seems to be all but certain that the 23-year-old Kosovan will leave Bremen at the end of the season. The only question is where he'll go. Liverpool, Leipzig and Dortmund are all seen as potential destinations. Werder's sporting director, Frank Baumann, could really use the cash Rashica should bring on the transfer market, especially if the club go down. He still has two years left on his contract in Dortmund, but there are no shortage of rumors. Sancho is probably England's most gifted player at the moment, so it's no wonder that some of the Premier League's top clubs would love to bring the 20-year-old home. Manchester United and Chelsea are thought to have the inside track. Playing in the Champions League is a priority for the youngster. The man who scored the goal that won Germany the 2014 World Cup will be out of contract in the summer, meaning Götze can leave BVB on a Bosman. During his short time at Hertha Berlin, Jürgen Klinsmann had expressed interest. There are also said to be several clubs in Italy, Spain and France who would like to sign the 27-year-old. AC Milan or Roma could be good bets to make it happen. Another World Cup winner is also on his way out at Dortmund. He's been on loan at Spartak Moscow but the Russians chose not to trigger a purchase option that would have set them back €7 million. If no offer comes from the Bundesliga, Schürrle can be expected to peddle his services to the highest bidder. Turkey or China seem like plausible landing points. The 25-year-old may not have played a single match in the Bundesliga, but the left back is on the wish list of several German clubs. Gosens, whose performances at Serie A outfit Atalanta have put him on Germany coach Joachim Löw's radar, is reportedly being courted by Borussia Dortmund, Eintracht Frankfurt and Schalke. His market value is estimated at €20 million. With his contract set to expire in 2021, RB Leipzig will need to move this summer if they are going to get a decent payoff for the 21-year-old . Bayern Munich are said to be interested, but the fixed transfer fee in his contract is €60 million. Leipzig are keen to extend his contract, but since it only runs for another year, his agent has been playing for time. According to Nice sporting director, Julien Fournier, the French U21 international is definitely on his way to the Bundesliga this summer. Mönchengladbach, Leverkusen, Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig are all said to be after Sarr, who is regarded as one of the biggest young defensive talents in Europe. Only a team that qualified for the Champions League will have any chance of landing the 21-year-old.

July 4 Rumor: Kai Havertz — Bayer Leverkusen to Bayern Munich Talking to Sport1, Bayern Chairperson Karl-Heinz Rummenigge outlined that a “Havertz transfer will not be financially possible for us this year.” The 64-year-old went on to say that his "wish for Rudi Völler [Bayer 04's sporting director] is that he stays one more year in Leverkusen." Rumor: Thiago — Bayern Munich to Liverpool Thiago reportedly has one foot out of Bayern's door with Rummenigge admitting that "it looks like he [Thiago] wants to do something new".
