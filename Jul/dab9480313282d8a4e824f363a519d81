July 15 -- IFAB extends five-subsitute option into 2021 The International Football Association Board (IFAB) which oversees football's Laws of the Game has extended the five-substitute option until July 2021. The maximum number of substitutes permitted per team was increased from three to five in countries where football restarted following the coronavirus-enforced break - a temporary amendment to "Law 3 - The Players" to ease the burden on footballers playing on tightened schedules and in different weather conditions. Justifying the extension of the amendment, the IFAB said it has taken into account the shorter-than-usual recovery/preparation period ahead of next season, as well as fixture congestion throughout the 2020/21 campaign. As before, teams will still only have three opportunities to make their five substitutions in order to avoid disruption to the game.
