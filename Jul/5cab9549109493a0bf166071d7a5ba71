A new trial began on Tuesday against Omar al-Bashir and some of his former allies. They are charged with leading the 1989 military coup that put Bashir in power. If found guilty, the 76-year-old Bashir could face the death penalty. State TV showed footage of the proceedings opening on Tuesday, but did not show images of Bashir himself. Dozens of people, mostly Bashir supporters, gathered outside the courthouse in Khartoum. The Islamist-backed coup that established Bashir's reign overthrew the democratically-elected government of Prime Minister Sadek al-Mahdi in 1989. Other defendants on trial Tuesday include former Bashir allies such as military officers and Islamists.
