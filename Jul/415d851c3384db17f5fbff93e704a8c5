Kanye West launched his last-minute presidential campaign on Sunday at an event in Charleston, South Carolina, in which he appeared onstage with the year "2020" shaved into his head and wearing a bullet-proof vest. West's lengthy, live-streamed monologue lasted roughly one hour and touched on drug policy, abortion, religion and even his own music business. Speaking without a microphone, he also solicited input from attendees. During one point, he criticized renowned 19th-century Black abolitionist Harriet Tubman, drawing the ire of some attendees. "Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves. She just had the slaves work for other white people," West said. Tubman, a former slave, set up the Underground Railroad, a secret network of routes and safe houses that helped enslaved people escape north to freedom. She later became a supporter of women's suffrage.

West said abortion should be legal — but heavily discouraged. He broke down in tears at one point as he described how he was nearly aborted by his parents. West suggested financial incentives for struggling mothers could help curb abortion. "Everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars," he said.
