Thousands of people turned out to a politically engaged LGBT+ Pride march in Paris on Saturday, a week after the officially scheduled event was set to take place. Pride parades around the world have been canceled owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Peaceful marchers eschewed the normal colorful floats and loud music that are hallmarks of Pride and instead focused on protesting racial inequality and police brutality. Many marchers held "Black Lives Matter" and chanted slogans such as "Everyone hates the police." Many protesters wore face masks and maintained social distancing. The unofficial protest was led by grassroots LGBT+ groups, many of which are vocal critics of Inter-LGBT, the group that organizes Paris Pride. Inter-LGBT has rescheduled Paris Pride for November.
