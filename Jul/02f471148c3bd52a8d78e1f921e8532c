A hiker in the southwestern German state of Saarland was seriously injured when he was trampled by several cows, local police authorities reported late Friday. The 67-year-old was out hiking with his dog near the village of Beckingen-Düppenweiler, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Saarbrücken on Thursday, when he tried to cross a cattle pasture, Saarland police reports said. He became caught between a herd of running cattle and was knocked to the ground, where the cows ran over him.
