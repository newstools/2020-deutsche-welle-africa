"We can only regret such unfriendly steps," said Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. "Of course, the principle of reciprocity and some kind of retaliatory response will apply to the extent that it suits the interests of the Russian Federation." Asked about the response from the Kremlin, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "The Foreign Secretary has made clear that this sanctions regime is not intended to target countries. It's a smart tool allowing for the targeted sanctioning of individuals and entities involved in serious violations or abuses of human rights." Of the 49 "individual" sanctions issued by the UK on Monday, 25 were tied to Russians and 20 to Saudi Arabians. Read more:  Can Nord Stream 2 pipeline still be completed despite US sanctions?
