A fox has stolen around 100 shoes from people's homes in Berlin's southwestern Zehlendorf neighborhood, according to local media reports. All types of footwear had started disappearing from outside homes in the district, including slippers and sandals as well as sneakers, before the unlikely thief was unmasked by local resident Christian Meyer. Meyer initially noticed his running shoes had disappeared and posted an inquiry on Germany's community noticeboard-sharing platform Nebenan.de, reported Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel. After posting, it became apparent that his were not the only shoes to have vanished in the area.
