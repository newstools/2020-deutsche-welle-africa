The goal for all countries is to make it to the blue part of the chart and stay there. Countries and territories in this section reported zero new cases both this week (past seven days) and the week before. Currently, that is the case for 16 out of 209 countries and territories.   Please note: The number of newly reported cases highly depends on a country’s ability to conduct tests and its strategy for administering tests. How has the Covid-19 trend evolved over the past weeks? The situation has deteriorated slightly: 98 countries report more cases this week than last week.
