The firm's former chief executive, Markus Braun, is under investigation by federal prosecutors. The scandal sparked criticism of auditors and regulators meant to be overseeing the firm. BaFin head Felix Hufeld has admitted it "had not been effective enough" in monitoring Wirecard.

That would allow for the nation's financial regulator to directly intervene, according to Scholz. Moreover, Scholz wants to give BaFin "more control rights over financial reports, regardless of whether the company has a banking division or not." He said large payment providers should be subject to financial supervision in general. Scholz added that the institution, which is under the supervision the finance ministry, should be strengthened in terms of personnel. "If we come to the conclusion that BaFin needs more money, more jobs and more competency, I will make every effort to ensure that this happens," the finance minister said. dv/aw (AFP, dpa)
