Russia on Saturday denied claims that negotiations were underway for the country to participate in a Group of Seven (G7) summit this year, six years after it was expelled. "We have not had negotiations of any kind and are not having any," Deputy Defense Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in Moscow. The comment came after the US ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, said in an interview with RBC TV that Washington was in talks with the Russian foreign ministry on the subject.

Under Trump's presidency, tensions between China and the US have reached fever pitch. Trump originally planned to go ahead with the G7 summit during the summer, but after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others said they would not attend because of the coronavirus pandemic, the event was postponed to September or later. ed/mm (dpa, Reuters)
