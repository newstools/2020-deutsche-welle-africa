An employee of Germany's Federal Press Office was found to have worked for an Egyptian secret service for years, according to a report presented on Thursday by Interior Minister Horst Seehofer. "We are not commenting on ongoing investigations or on personnel matters," said Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman and the head of the Federal Press Office. The man is said to have been working for the visitor service of the press office as a mid-level employee, according to the German daily Bild. This means he would have completed an exam and at least two years of vocational training to obtain the job. According to the report, German police carried out "executive measures" against the man in December 2019. The premises of the visitor service were searched as part of the investigation, Bild reported.

The German government believes that Egyptian secret services seek to gather information about Egyptians living in Germany who may be members of the Muslim Brotherhood, but also members of the Coptic Christian community.
