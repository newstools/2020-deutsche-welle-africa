A man who stole weapons from four police officers and then evaded capture in Germany's Black Forest for five days was caught Friday, police announced. The 31-year-old homeless man was detained by the police and several weapons in his possession were taken by the police. The man was confronted by four police officers in a hut in the forest near the town of Offenburg in southern Germany last Sunday before he overpowered them and stole their weapons. Hundreds of police officers and helicopters spent five days using infrared cameras to try to locate the man, but he managed to evade capture for almost a week. German media dubbed him "Black Forest Rambo" as the man donned camouflage gear while he was hiding. The man will now face a psychiatric assessment and will undergo tests for alcohol or substance abuse. Hundreds of police descended on the small Black Forest community Suspect was a 'woodsman' The man was sitting in a bush when he was arrested, police said at a press conference. His weapons, including an ax, and a letter lay in front of him while police attempted to coax him out. The man and several police officers were slightly injured during the arrest. Police called for the man to act "rationally" earlier on Friday and appealed for him to "make contact" with the police. Shortly after that authorities said he was in police custody. Prosecutor Herwig Schäfer described the man as a "woodsman" who appeared to know how to survive in the forest. Police discovered various weapons at an apartment where the man used to live before he became homeless last year. ed/sms (AFP, dpa)
