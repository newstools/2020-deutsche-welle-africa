Prime Minister Boris Johnson began reshaping his government on Thursday, in hopes of tightening his grip on power. The UK leader is seeking a team that will help him deliver his vision for Brexit. In a surprise move, Britain's finance minister, Sajid Javid, submitted his resignation just weeks after Brexit and one month before he was set to deliver the government's annual budget. Seeking to minimize any disruption from the cabinet reshuffle, Johnson quickly announced the appointment of Javid's deputy Rishi Sunak, as a replacement. Nonetheless, Javid’s surprise departure caused the value of the pound to dip.

The UK PM has also sacked Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, who had been widely praised for helping to end a political deadlock that left Northern Ireland without a regional government and assembly for three years. Among the cabinet members who are keeping their posts were Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Priti Patel, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove. British opposition politicians criticized Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle, saying it was a mess. "This is a historical record. A government in chaos within weeks of an election," said John McDonnell, finance spokesman for the main opposition Labour Party. jcg/rc (AP, AFP, Reuters) Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3Xgrh Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
