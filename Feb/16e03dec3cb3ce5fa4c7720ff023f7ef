Erling Haaland cannot stop scoring. His two strikes in the Champions League on Tuesday were his 10th and 11th goals since joining Borussia Dortmund in January. They also gave him 10 goals in the Champions League, the most by any player after seven games in the competition. But most of all, it gave Dortmund a valuable 2-1 lead over Paris Saint-Germain after the first leg of their last 16 tie. "These are the nights you live for," Haaland told DAZN, a sports streaming service, after Tuesday's game. The Norwegian striker is just 19, and he has worn black and yellow for less than two months, but he is already Dortmund's most valuable player. The German side may only go as far in the Champions League as Haaland takes them. As it happened...

In the prematch press conference, the German played down the significance of his personal history at the club, saying that he was solely focused on the "huge challenge" that his team would be facing over the two legs. Both teams are very capable of scoring, but Dortmund have also shipped a lot of goals in recent weeks, and BVB coach Lucien Favre told the prematch press conference that his team would be looking to keep the score down on Tuesday night. Dortmund are hoping the newly arrived defensive midfielder Emre Can will help shore things up at the back. Dortmund could also field another arrival, 19-year-old striker Erling Haaland in Europe for the first time. The Norwegian has scored nine goals in six games in all competitions for Dortmund, but he also scored eight in six matches for his former club, Salzburg in the group stage. Tuchel, on the other hand, said he expected Neymar to be available after returning from injury. "If we have Neymar on the field, we have the self-confidence,'' Tuchel said. "It changes everything for us."
