Russia has delivered Pantsir S1 air-defense systems to Belgrade, the Serbian Defense Ministry confirmed Saturday. "Serbia strengthened its defensive and deterrent capabilities," the ministry said via a statement. "In this way, our ability to remain militarily neutral is further strengthened, which is a fundamental security commitment of the Commander-in-Chief of the Serbian Armed Forces, Aleksandar Vucic, our Government and the Assembly," the Ministry of Defense added. President Vucic is known for his strongman characteristics and though he holds a ceremonial position in the Serbian government, he is still the Balkan country's most powerful politician. The purchase of the defense systems, made up of radar, ground-to-air missiles and 30-mm cannon, was agreed last year. The rapid-fire system is intended for defense against cruise missiles, drones and aircraft at an altitude of up to 15,000 meters, as well as a range of up to 20 kilometers. Close ties The news comes just days after Russia's defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, visited Belgrade where he declared that the two nations had reached a "fundamentally” new level. Serbia remains a key ally of Russia even though it is a European Union candidate country. Serbia has pledged to stay out of NATO and refused to join sanctions by the West against the Kremlin over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. jsi/aw (Interfax, dpa, Beta) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
