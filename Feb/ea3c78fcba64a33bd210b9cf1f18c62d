The results were worse than forecast, with predictions of 0.1% growth. However, Destastis revised its results for the third quarter, with the GDO growing by 0.2% instead of the 0.1% previously reported.

The European Central bank has been trying to stimulate growth and inflation in the 19-country eurozone, with negative interest rates and bond purchases with newly printed money. Germany's manufacturing and export sectors have been sluggish, but consumer spending and services businesses helped keep the country out of recession.

Europe's three biggest economies all stagnated or shrank in the last three months of the year. aw/rc (dpa, AFP, AP)
