Many of you have sent us photos this week showing your favourite vegetarian dish. Many thanks to all the participants.  All entries entered our draw for a wristwatch in the exclusive Euromaxx design among all entries. Martha Patricia Gomez from Colombia is our vegetarian favorite. It’s a "couscous Andino" – the North-African dish, but prepared with ingredients from the Colombian cuisine of the Andes.  Congratulations!
