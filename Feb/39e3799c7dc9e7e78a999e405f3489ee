Six Supreme Court judges are down with H1N1, otherwise known as swine flu, said Judge Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud of India's Supreme Court on Tuesday. He added that a meeting will be held with the country's Chief of Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde to discuss measures including possible vaccinations of those working in the Supreme Court.
