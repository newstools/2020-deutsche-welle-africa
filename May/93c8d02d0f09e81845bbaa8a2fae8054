The 20-year-old flew into Frankfurt Airport on Sunday and then tried to disguise himself as a janitor in order get past the airport security checkpoint. The man put on a reflective vest and grabbed two black trash bags and headed towards the checkpoint, pretending he was there to empty the trash cans. However, a "watchful employee" noticed that the man had no security ID and that he could also not speak German. She informed the police, who in turn detained the US national, the authorities said in their report. When questioned by the police, the man admitted that he hatched the plot because he saw no legal possibility to see his Germany-based girlfriend.
