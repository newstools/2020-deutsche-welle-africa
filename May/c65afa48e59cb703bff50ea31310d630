German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas held a video conference with several of his counterparts across the EU on Monday to discuss efforts to reopen borders and restart the tourism economy. Travel and tourism account for a major part of GDP in member states like Italy, Croatia, Spain, and Greece. Maas still struck a cautious note after the talks. Under the new plans, cross-border movement will be reinstated in phases, based on coronavirus transmission rates and coordinated by EU member states. "It will be crucial to ensure that our citizens cannot just travel freely within Europe, but can also safely return home," the ministers said in a joint statement. Maas said he hoped to lift Germany's blanket travel ban after the current one expires on June 14 and instead offer guidance for individual countries. But he still struck a cautious note after the talks. "We shouldn't get too excited about the possibility of a quick return to 'business as usual,'" he said. "We want to make summer holidays possible, but only under responsible circumstances. That is why it will be necessary to tell people very clearly that there will be restrictions everywhere — on beaches, in restaurants and in city centers." Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias was particularly confident in his country's ability to provide a safe summer vacation spot in comments to German newspaper group Redaktions Netzwerk Deutschland, and was keen to urge German tourists not to cancel their plans. "The aim is to reestablish free and safe travel within the EU," he said. Greece has emerged as one of EU member states least affected by the coronavirus pandemic, partly due to an extremely strict and very early lockdown. In a country of 10.5 million people, there have only been 2,834 recorded cases of COVID-19 and 163 deaths. The country has already begun to reopen its institutions and economy, including its world-famous beaches. Read more: Which European Union countries are open for summer tourism?

This will make travel to neighbouring countries much easier. From Saturday (May 16), Germany will again open its borders to neighboring countries France, Austria and Switzerland.

He did not name an exact date for the opening of borders. "A normal holiday season with crowded beach bars and busy mountain huts will not be possible this summer. That would be unacceptable," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Tuesday (April 21).

The Oktoberfest has been cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Bavaria's premier Markus Söder and Munich's mayor Dieter Reiter announced the decision on Tuesday (April 21). "It pains us, and it is a great pity", said Söder.
