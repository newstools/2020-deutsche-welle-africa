Rolf Herbrechtsmeier, 52, was convicted of fraud on 37 counts and attempted fraud on nine counts by the district court. A further charge of tax evasion was dropped. The man's wife, 44, was given an 18-month suspended sentence for her role in the scheme. State prosecutors say Herbrechtsmeier assisted thousands of drivers who had lost their license in Germany by helping them acquire a new one in another EU country. However, several of his customers never received their new documents, despite paying, the 188-page indictment that included more than 1,000 witnesses said. Herbrechtsmeier, whose defense team had been seeking an acquittal, told the court some 100 kilometers (62 miles) west-southwest of Hanover that he plans to appeal. jsi/msh (dpa) Each evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
