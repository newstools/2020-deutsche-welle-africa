Germany Some border crossings with neighbors Austria, Switzerland, and France began to open on May 16 under tightly controlled conditions, with June 15 set as the date to fully relax borders and restrictions on inter-EU travel. Germany also lifted its strict border controls with Luxembourg on the same day. A similar deal with Denmark has been reached, although a date has not yet been announced. An official government proposal to reopen the borders by June 15, called the "Criteria for the Enabling of Intra-European Tourism" is set to be decided upon on Wednesday. Under the proposal, Germany’s general travel warning will be replaced by individual travel advice, which highlights the separate risks for each individual country. "The revitalization of tourism is important both for travelers and the German travel industry, as well as for the economic stability of the respective target countries," the proposal read. Austria Vienna also gave June 15 as the official date for reopening the country's inter-EU borders — but it reopened two crossings into Hungary on May 13 due to the difficulties faced by individuals who live on one side of the border but work on the other. Austria also opened its border to some traffic from Germany on May 15. Austrian alpine tourism relies heavily on German visitors, as its mountain resorts are very popular with their neighbors. Indeed, large groups of people returning to Germany from Austrian ski destinations were behind the first surge of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany. Vienna expects to have similar agreements with Switzerland and its other eastern neighbors soon. Authorities have said, however, that some random health spot checks will be performed on foreigners entering the country, although fewer than are being done now. From today (May 26) one of the most sacred places of Christianity will be open to the public again. Only 50 people can enter the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem; wearing facemasks is compulsory.

At 368 meters (1207 ft.), the Berlin Television Tower is the tallest building in Germany and a popular tourist hotspot. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Japanese authorities have imposed a climbing ban on Mount Fuji on May 18, and all four routes on the mountain have been closed.

In Greece, all beaches in the country were reopened on May 16. According to media reports, strict regulations were observed: The distance between parasols had to be four meters and only two sunbeds per parasol were allowed. Beach bars could only sell packaged food and not serve alcohol. Is this a preview of summer holidays in Europe despite the coronavirus pandemic? From May 15, people entering North Rhine-Westphalia from other EU countries and Schengen states no longer have to go into a 14-day home quarantine. The other German states are to follow in the next few days. Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland are also exempt from the quarantine regulations, making travel to neighboring countries much easier. On May 16, Germany opened its borders to neighboring countries France, Austria and Switzerland. There will only be random checks, and no more checks at all for Luxembourg. However, there must still be "good" reasons for crossing the border. And love is accepted as such. For example, German-Swiss couples at Lake Constance (photo) — can visit each other again. The Austrian government has announced that the border with Germany will be opened on June 15. Tourism in Austria has been effectively suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. On May 29, hotels and other accommodation in Austria will be allowed to reopen. Austrian tourism is heavily dependent on guests from Germany.

However, day tourists and hotel overnight stays are still prohibited. Thuringians are pioneers. Weimar is the first city in Germany to reopen restaurants and cafés. Since May 6, people have been sitting in the sun with a coffee or beer and enjoying a step back towards normality — while keeping their distance. Restaurants and hotels in the other federal states will also resume their limited operations by the end of May. Holidaymakers might also be able to travel to the Balearic or Greek Islands in summer. "If there are very few new infections there and the medical care works, one could also think about a summer holiday in those places", the government's commissioner for tourism, Thomas Bareiss, told the Tagesspiegel newpaper. Long-distance travel, however, is likely to be cancelled this summer. On May 18, the coronavirus lockdown for Bavaria's outdoor gastronomy ended and the beer gardens have reopened.

From May 30, the operation of hotels, and holiday homes in Bavaria will be allowed again. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is the first federal state to reopen to tourists from all over Germany: From May 25th they can again stay in hotels, guest houses and holiday homes. 60 percent of the bed capacity will be released for this purpose. This means that the tourist season can start with the Whitsun holidays in popular holiday regions like the Baltic Sea and the Mecklenburg Lake District. One of Beijing's most important sights can be visited again after months of closure due to the coronavirus crisis. From Friday (May 1), visitors are allowed back into the palace complex on Tiananmen Square under strict security conditions. Instead of the previously usual 80,000 visitors, a maximum of 5,000 guests are to be admitted daily. Germany extended on Wednesday (April 29) its worldwide travel warning due to the coronavirus crisis to at least June 14. The Federal Foreign Office said that "severe and drastic restrictions in international air and travel traffic and worldwide entry restrictions, quarantine measures and restrictions on public life in many countries can still be expected." Gastronomes have set up empty chairs in central locations in Germany, such as here in Düsseldorf, to draw attention to their situation in the coronavirus crisis. "Without direct financial aid, most of our businesses will not survive," says Guido Zöllick, President of the German Hotel and Restaurant Association. "Suppliers and partners are also increasingly being drawn deeper into economic crisis." Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is confident that the border between Austria and Germany will soon be opened again for tourists. Both countries are on the right track in containing the spread of the coronavirus, Kurz told ARD television on Wednesday (April 22). This is the precondition for a revival of tourism. He did not name an exact date for the opening of borders. "A normal holiday season with crowded beach bars and busy mountain huts will not be possible this summer. That would be unacceptable," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Tuesday (April 21). However, he did not rule out the possibility that borders for tourists could be reopened before the summer and that holiday travel with certain restrictions might be possible. The Oktoberfest has been cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Bavaria's premier Markus Söder and Munich's mayor Dieter Reiter announced the decision on Tuesday (April 21). "It pains us, and it is a great pity", said Söder. But in times of the coronavirus, the danger of infection at the folk festival, which attracts about six million visitors annually, would just be too great. The Prime Minister of Schleswig-Holstein, Daniel Günther, hopes that tourism on the North and Baltic Seas will be revived in the summer. Despite the coronavirus crisis, he "definitely did not write off the summer tourism business," he said on April 19. While they are now proscribed, stays in secondary residences, holiday homes and finally hotels could be made possible again in three steps. The government resolutions (April 15th) stipulate that people in Germany should continue to refrain from making private trips. The worldwide travel warning is to be upheld. Accommodation offers are only available for necessary and explicitly non-touristic purposes. Restaurants will also remain closed. Tourism is one of the industries that has been hit hardest in the coronavirus crisis. The entry ban imposed by the USA on foreign nationals from Europe will remain in place for the time being. Italy and Spain are still struggling with the coronavirus crisis and France has just extended measures to contain infections by the virus, US President Donald Trump said on Monday (April 13).

Tourists in the Pacific Islands must first be rounded up in New Zealand and then flown out. After long delays Thailand closed its borders on Thursday (March 26). The authorities had delayed the decision for a long time to safeguard the tourism sector. Now tens of thousands of tourists are stuck in the Southeast Asian tourist country. The German government has so far not organized a repatriation for German tourists, as Thailand is not considered a risk region. The German foreign ministry announced on Wednesday (March 25) that, together with tour operators, it had brought back more than 150,000 Germans from abroad. Tour operator TUI added that almost 95 percent of the tourists who were stranded because of the coronavirus pandemic are now back in Germany. They were mainly flown out from Egypt, Spain, Portugal and the Cape Verde Islands. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has said that the warning against traveling abroad will remain in effect until the end of April. "This includes the Easter holidays," he said on Twitter. "Stay at home! Protect yourself and your fellow human beings," he appealed to the population. Many tour operators have also extended their travel ban until the end of April. The EU Commission is supporting the return to Europe of tens of thousands of long-distance travellers. It intends to cover a large part of the costs, since most of the flight connections have been cancelled.

Author: Andreas Kirchhoff, Susan Bonney-Cox France Arrivals in France from the Schengen open-border zone, which includes Switzerland, will be exempt from the quarantine. France will still keep its borders mostly shut until June 15, except to people who need to travel in and out frequently for work. France had entered into an agreement with the UK to allow passage back and forth without the country's mandatory 14-day quarantine, seen as an essential economic measure due to the flow of delivery vehicles that passes between the two countries. But Downing Street on May 15 walked back on the plan, saying it would no longer exempt French arrivals from quarantine. Italy While the country where Europe's outbreak first took serious hold has never technically ordered its borders closed, the extreme measures put in place at airports to stop the spread of the virus and border closures ordered by its neighbors have pretty much cut it off to international travel. Starting on June 3, citizens of EU countries will once again be allowed to travel to Italy. Curbs on inter-regional travel within Italy will also be lifted in early June. Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio on Tuesday also hailed calls for a joint re-launch of European tourism in mid-June, referring to the day that borders open again as being a new "D-Day." "Let’s work together so that on June 15 Europe can start anew. June 15 is a little bit like European D-Day for tourism," Di Maio said in a television interview, referring to Germany’s draft proposal to lift travel bans. "Germany is looking at a deadline of June 15 to reopen. We are working with Austria and we will work with other European countries," he said. Tourism is a major element of the Italian economy. Under normal circumstances, it is the fifth-most visited country in the world. Tourism accounts for 10% of GDP and nearly 5% of employment. Spain Also heavily reliant on foreign tourism, Spain has reopened its borders but imposed a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine regulation on anyone who arrives in the country. However, Spain announced that it will lift the mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from July, with its foreign minister issuing an enthusiastic tweet to welcome foreign tourists. "The worst is behind us," Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya tweeted, with emojis of a bikini, sunglasses and a suitcase. "In July we will gradually open Spain to international tourists, lift the quarantine, ensure the highest standards of health safety. We look forward 2 welcoming you!” she wrote. Spain also lifted restrictions in some of its biggest cities on Monday, with restaurants and bars opening up in Barcelona and the capital Madrid. Spain normally draws over 80 million tourists per year, with travel accounting for over 12% of the country’s gross domestic product. Portugal Another top tourist destination, Portugal's tourism board has said that the country's beaches and hotels will be ready to welcome tourists by mid-June. However, there is still concern about how to check that new arrivals have been tested for the coronavirus, a measure the government wants to see implemented, and how to control whether social distancing rules are maintained on beaches. A complete cancellation of the tourist season this year could cause the Portuguese economy to contract by up to 6%. Norway Although not an EU member state, Norway is a member of the European Economic Area and has been moving in tandem with Europe on several facets of the bloc's pandemic response.    As of May 13, travelers from EU nations (including the UK) as well as Iceland and Liechtenstein have been allowed to enter Norway for work or if they have family members living in the country. Oslo's decision is less related to tourism and more focused on allowing seasonal workers to enter Norway. Poland As other countries roll back their border controls, Warsaw announced that its strict closures will remain in place until June 12. However, diplomats, foreigners with Polish residency, and professional truck drivers were given permission to pass through specific checkpoints earlier this month. Like many EU member states, Poland has not given an indication of when international travel from beyond Europe might return to any semblance of pre-pandemic regularity. Iceland While also not an EU member, Iceland is in the Schengen area of visa-free travel and is popular with tourists. The government has announced that, like many of its European counterparts, it will begin easing restrictions on foreign travel on June 15. However, new arrivals will have to choose whether to submit to an immediate coronavirus test upon arrival or to complete a 14-day quarantine wherever they are staying. People arriving for certain work purposes, such as scientists, may be granted waivers from these requirements. Croatia Tourists from neighboring Slovenia were able to cross into Croatia earlier this month, after the negotiation of a deal that sees Slovenian tourists exempt from a mandatory 14-day quarantine after returning from abroad if they were coming from Croatia. Croatian Health Minister Gari Cappelli said in an interview with state broadcaster HRT that an easing of restrictions between the two borders could take place "because our epidemiological situations are similar." German tourists, who frequent Croatia’s many islands in the Adriatic Sea, will be allowed to visit Croatia no later than June 15, Cappelli said, adding that he expects similar deals will be struck with other EU nations soon. Greece has had one of the lowest rates of infection and fatalities after an early lockdown Greece Greece has said it aims to open its borders to European tourists by June 15, along with several other EU countries. However, an official date and has not been formally confirmed. Greece has had one of the lowest rates of infection and fatalities due to the pandemic in Europe as the result of an early and extremely strict lockdown — in some cases, residents were not even allowed to go grocery shopping, and were brought supplies instead. As such, the country is emerging perhaps healthier from the crisis than its neighbors. However, the government is still wary to open its borders in order to keep it that way. Greece also opened cafes to outdoor service this week – marking one of its first steps to lift lockdown measures. Slovenia Despite new infections still being reported, Slovenia's government declared an end to the COVID-19 epidemic in the country and reopened its borders for EU travelers on May 15. EU residents crossing into Slovenia from Hungary, Italy and Austria were also exempted from a mandatory seven-day quarantine. Most non-EU residents will still have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine, however. Anyone found to be exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms will be turned away at the border under the new regulations. Restrictions on the country's tourism branch also started to roll back this month, although initially only for small hotels and other smaller businesses. —Rebecca Staudenmaier contributed to this report Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
