Celebrated across the globe as V-Day (Victory Day), May 8 marks the end of the Second World War in Europe; when the Wehrmacht, or Nazi Germany's armed forces, surrendered to the Allies exactly 75 years ago. As the generation of Germans who survived the war dwindles, so, too, do the opportunities to record their stories. Wanting to better understand the friendship between a former Wehrmacht soldier and her own grandmother, Deutsche Welle journalist, Laura Bechert, invited both of them to sit down for a series of interviews. The result is an emotional journey through family history, decades’ long bonds, and Germany's hard-to-crack code of silence around that time.
