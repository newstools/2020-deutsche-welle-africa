A 54-year-old former German nurse was convicted Tuesday by a regional court in the central German city of Giessen of causing dangerous bodily harm for poisoning her colleagues at a hospital.  She was sentenced to three years in prison. According to prosecutors, on three occasions — twice in September 2017 and once in March 2019 — the woman put out drugged cookies and coffee in a kitchenette for her colleagues at the Kerckhoff Clinic in the town of Bad Nauheim in the central state of Hesse.

Several of her colleagues reported feeling dizzy, seeing double and fainting after eating the cookies. As one of the victims had a life-threatening reaction to the drugs, prosecutors initially charged the woman with one case of attempted murder. However, the court found there had been no intent to kill, and pursued a lesser charge of bodily harm.

During a search of her residence, police said they found empty packages of the anti-anxiety medication that came from the clinic, and traces of the substances in a mixer.
