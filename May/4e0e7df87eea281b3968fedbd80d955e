Twelve soldiers have been killed in an attack on a military outpost in Niger's Diffa region, scene of recent clashes with jihadist fighters, the country's Defense Ministry said Tuesday. The attack by "Boko Haram terrorists" overnight Monday on the Blabrine military base left another 10 soldiers wounded, the ministry said in a statement. It is not immediately clear how many attackers were killed in the incident, which took place at Niger's Blabrine military base, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Diffa town in the remote southeastern region near Lake Chad, where the borders of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria converge.

Boko Haram's insurgency has so far claimed more than 36,000 lives since it began in northeastern Nigeria in 2009 and displaced nearly two million from their homes. see/sri (AFP, dpa) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
