Greece is located in a highly seismically active area and experiences hundreds of quakes each year. The last deadly quake occurred in the island of Kos in the Aegean Sea in July 2017. The 6.7-magnitude quake killed two people. The deadliest temblor in recent years struck the Athens region in 1999, killing 143 people. Saturday's quake was stronger than most but took place relatively far from populated areas. mm/dr (AP, Reuters)
