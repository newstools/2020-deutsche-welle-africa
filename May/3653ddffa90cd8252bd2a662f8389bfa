German police responded to a different kind of emergency in the small hours of Tuesday morning, rescuing a helpless hedgehog whose snout was stuck in an abandoned plastic drinks container. Police believe the animal was drawn to the smell of an old banana shake and got its head stuck inside the cup.

Bremerhaven police later tweeted a photo of the little guy with the caption "too tempting."
