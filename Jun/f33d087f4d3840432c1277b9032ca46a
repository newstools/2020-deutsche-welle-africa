June 9 -- Madrid want to host rescheduled Champions League Final The mayor of Madrid has claimed the city is being considered as a host for this season's Champions League final amid the possibility that original host Istanbul won't be able to fulfill its obligations due to the coronavirus pandemic. The final was due to be played at the Ataturk Stadium on May 30 until the tournament was postponed and Uefa's executive committee will meet on June 17 to determine a new plan. "I know steps are being taken in this regard and on behalf of the city council, I want to show my total and absolute support for the Champions League final being held in Madrid," Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida told Spanish television station Trece. Reports suggest Uefa will explore options to host all remaining games in both the Champions and Europa leagues within the same cities. Lisbon, Moscow, and Frankfurt are three other cities that have reportedly made pitches to host the European club tournaments. While Lisbon appeared to be the favorite for the Champions League fixtures, prior to Madrid's interest, Frankfurt could be in line to host the remaining Europa League games, according to German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. June 9 -- Höwedes terminates Lokomotiv Moscow contract to remain in Germany 2014 World Cup winner Benedikt Höwedes has thanked Lokomotiv Moscow on his Twitter account for terminating his contract to allow him to remain in Germany. Lokomotiv said in their Twitter announcement that Höwedes' contract was terminated by mutual consent due to family reasons.

Höwedes does not have a new team lined up in Germany, but there is speculation that he could return to Schalke, where he spent the first 10 years of his professional football career. The Russian Premier League is set to resume from its coronavirus hiatus on June 21 despite thousands of new cases per day. Höwedes has been critical of Russia's handling of the pandemic. -- Zero positive tests in Basketball Bundesliga The BBL, Germany's top basketball league, said that all coronavirus tests it conducted after the start of its end-of-season tournament came back negative. Brose Bamberg, the final team to be tested, "tested completely negative," BBL hygiene officer Florian Kainzinger said on Twitter on Tuesday.

The International Cricket Council is expected to order a temporary ban on using spit during matches as a way to combat the spread of the new coronavirus. Fast blowers sometimes use saliva or sweat to shine one side of the ball when bowling, making the ball swing in the air. Sweat, which is considered less effective, could still be allowed. "Maybe there are other ways that ICC needs to look in, assisting the bowler maybe in giving them something," Lee, a former Australian pace bowler, said on Tendulkar's 100MB online app. -- Relief fund for Brazilian clubs Brazil's football federation (CBF) has established a relief fund of worth 100 million Brazilian real (€18.4 million, $20.7 million) to help top-flight clubs overcome the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The CBF has also allocated 15 million Brazilian real for second division clubs. Football in Brazil has been suspended since march due to the pandemic. The country has more than 700,000 confirmed cases, second most in the world behind the United States, and more than 37,000 virus-related deaths, third behind the US and Britain. June 8 -- Champions League final in Lisbon, not Frankfurt Reports in Germany suggest that UEFA are set to select Lisbon as the location for a possible Champions League final tournament in order to bring the 2019/20 competition to a close. German cities Munich and Frankfurt had been touted as options to host a mini-tournament, having already hosted Bundesliga "ghost games" and successfully implemented the German Football League's hygiene concept. Bayern Munich board member Oliver Kahn had signalled Munich's readiness, while Eintracht Frankfurt's director of sport Fredi Bobic said such an event, including stadia in Frankfurt, Mainz and Hoffenheim, would have been "a great chance." But, according to the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, UEFA appear to favor the Portuguese capital for financial reasons, although the fact that there are no Portuguese sides left in the tournament is also important. Speaking to Sky90, Bobic hinted: "It's not just a sporting issue, it's a question of finances, too. And taxes can be a problem in Germany." A final decision is expected when UEFA's executive committee meets on June 17 and 18. The Champions League was originally due to take place in Istanbul on May 30, but the Turkish city is now out of the running. The competition was suspended indefinitely on March 13, with four last-16 second legs still to play, including Bayern's home game against Chelsea. UEFA now hopes to fulfil those fixtures, plus four quarterfinal matches, two semifinals (all one-legged) and the final, in a mini-tournament in one location - likely Lisbon, pictured above.

June 1 -- Bundesliga: thoughts turning to fans‘ return Bayern Munich board member Oliver Kahn has said that the club has already begun considering concepts to allow supporters to return to Bundesliga stadia. "Of course we’ve had a look [at the options],” Kahn told broadcaster Sky on Sunday evening, a day after Bayern had hammered Fortuna Düsseldorf 5-0, adding that he is “definitely in favor of thinking about fans again sooner or later." Kahn, the former Bayern goalkeeper and captain who is set to replace Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as CEO in 2022, said he could imagine “a fraction of capacity” being used at the Allianz Arena, perhaps “10-11,000” spectators. "We have to keep thinking, step by step," he said. "Dortmund versus Bayern without fans – that’s madness. But we have to accept that and deal with it for the time being." Borussia Dortmund’s head of professional football, Sebastian Kehl, also hopes that the fans will soon be back. "Maybe in autumn," he told the Fuldaer Zeitung. "The question is when a degree of normality can return to our society and what road the politicians want to take," said the former BVB captain. -- Salary cap 'unrealistic' The former head of the German Football League (DFL) says that the introduction of salary caps in European football is an "unrealistic scenario" due to the dominance of England’s Premier League. "As the market leader, the Premier League would not be interested in restricting themselves," Andreas Retting told German public broadcaster SWR. "They’re all businesses with the aim of making profit, why should they give up their competitive advantage?" Rettig, who was also CEO of second division side St Pauli from 2015-2019, is a well-known critic of the commercialization of football and likely aware of the various suggestions which have been made to restructure the game in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. But the 57-year-old doesn’t think salary caps, as used in American sports, are feasible. "There’s no promotion or relegation in the USA and the franchises there are all similarly structured," he said. "But it’s different [in Europe]. With clubs competing to qualify for international competitions, there are other competitions to be taken into account." -- Spanish football back in full training Spanish clubs resumed full squad training on Monday. Clubs will have just under two weeks of full sessions before the league restarts on June 11, almost three months after it was stopped because of COVID-19. -- Football with fans returns This weekend in Hungary, football with fans returned.
