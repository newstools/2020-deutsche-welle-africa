The number of inhabitants in Germany is the highest that it's ever been, the Federal Statistical Office reported on Friday. At the end of 2019, the total population was 83.2 million, which is 147,000, or 0.2% more than the previous year. The population has been growing continuously since 2011, according to the report, partially due to migration. The increase in 2019 in particular is because 300,000 people migrated to the country.
