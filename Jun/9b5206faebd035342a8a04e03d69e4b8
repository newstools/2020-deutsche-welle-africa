These charts and this article are updated every Friday between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. UTC/GMT. What’s the current global trend?  The goal for all countries is to make it to the blue part of the chart and stay there. Countries and territories in this section reported zero new cases both this week (past seven days) and the week before. Currently, that is the case for 27 out of 209 countries and territories.   Please note: The number of newly reported cases highly depends on a country’s ability to conduct tests and its strategy for administering tests. What is the current Covid-19 trend in my country? Based on the newly reported case numbers – which can reflect local outbreaks as well as country-wide spread – in the past 14 days, countries and territories classify as follows: More than twice as many cases this week as last week: More cases this week than last week: About the same number of cases in both weeks (no change or plus/minus seven cases): Fewer cases this week than last week: Less than half as many cases as last week Zero cases this week as well as last week:  How has the Covid-19 trend evolved over the past weeks? The picture remains almost unchanged.  These charts and this article are updated every Friday between 1pm and 4pm (CET +1h).
