Several police officers were injured as riots and looting were carried out in the German city of Stuttgart early on Sunday morning. Dozens of small groups of people in the city center threw stones at authorities, smashed cars and broke shop windows. "The situation is completely out of control," a police spokesperson said. "It is developing into real riots," they added. Twenty people were arrested. Police said the riots happened after police conducted checks in the city center related to suspected drug dealing. Several groups then ganged up on police and started to threaten them. Police were "confronted in an extremely aggressive manner, attacked and injured," the police report said. Shortly after 3 a.m. the situation appeared to have calmed. Authorities said several hundred people were involved in the riots, which took place in the Stuttgart's central shopping district and lasted for several hours. Several businesses and vehicles were damaged in the city, which is the capital of the German state of Baden-Württemberg and one of Germany's biggest cities. On Sunday, Stuttgart's mayor, Fritz Kuhn wrote on Twitter that he was "shocked about the violent outbreak..." He said it was "a sad Sunday for Stuttgart" and that authorities would analyze the situation "thoroughly." He retweeted a video from regional public television SWR that shows some of the violence. The state premier of Baden-Württemberg, Winfried Kretschmann, also condemned what he called the "brutal outbreak of violence" in Stuttgart. "These actions against people and things are criminal acts that should be prosecuted and brought to justice," he said. "We can’t remain unmoved by the pictures from downtown Stuttgart." He adding that his thoughts were with the injured police officers and others injured in the rioting. The facts need to clarified and the people responsible should be identified as swiftly as possible, he said. ed, kp/ng (AFP, dpa) You can subsribe to DW's newsletters here:
