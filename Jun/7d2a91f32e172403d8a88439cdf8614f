An Iranian man was sentenced to death on Tuesday for providing intel to the United States and Israel on the location of slain Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. The man, identified as Mahmoud MM [DPA didn't give his full name… other agencies did], was accused of passing on information about Soleimani's whereabouts to the CIA and the Mossad and that he was paid for this information, a Justice Ministry spokesperson said. The man will soon be executed, according to state news agency IRNA. The ministry spokesman did not release further details released about Mahmoud MM or how he managed to obtain information about Soleimani's whereabouts. Officials also did not comment on whether the information provided was linked to Soleimani's killing in Iraq.
