A highly dangerous World War II explosive was found in a garage in the northern German city of Hamburg, police said Sunday. The explosive was discovered when a flat was being cleared a day earlier. Police closed off an adjacent park and called out the bomb disposal squad to carry out a controlled explosion. The fire brigade confirmed that the object was a hazardous anti-aircraft grenade detonator with an explosive device. The bomb disposal squad could not defuse the relic at the scene, and instead had to conduct a controlled blast in an adjacent park.
