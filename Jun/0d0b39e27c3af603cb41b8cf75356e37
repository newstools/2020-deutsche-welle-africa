NASA's headquarters in Washington DC will be renamed in honor of the US space agency's first African-American female engineer, Mary W. Jackson, officials announced on Wednesday. "Mary never accepted the status quo, she helped break barriers and open opportunities for African Americans and women in the field of engineering and technology," NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. Jackson started working for the US space agency in the 1950s at a time when NASA was racially segregated. She was officially promoted to an engineer in 1958. Her work, and the work of the agency's other black female mathematicians was largely unrecognized until a book and subsequent Hollywood film "Hidden Figures" brought their story into the public.

Promoting women at NASA Jackson's daughter, Carolyn Lewis, said that she and the rest of her family were "honored" by NASA's decision. "She was a scientist, humanitarian, wife, mother, and trailblazer who paved the way for thousands of others to succeed, not only at NASA, but throughout this nation," Lewis said. Over her decades-long career at NASA, Jackson also led programs that advocated for the hiring and promotion of women at NASA, particularly in the agency's science, technology, engineering and mathematics departments.
