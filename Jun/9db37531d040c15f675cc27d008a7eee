Chelsea are closing in on the signature of RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner, British media reported on Thursday. Werner had also been attracting interest from Premier League champions-elect Liverpool. Now, it appears Chelsea have met the German's reported release clause of some €60 million (£53 million, $67 million). Werner, who moved to Leipzig from Stuttgart in 2016, is expected to earn about £200,000 per week. Should the transfer go ahead, it would be something of a coup for Chelsea. For the past year, the speculation has been that Werner was on his way to Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool side. Liverpool are on the verge of winning the Premier League when the competition resumes amid a gradual loosening of the UK's COVID-19 lockdown. The Germany international has scored 31 goals for Leipzig in all competitions.
