Japan will cancel the deployment of a multibillion-dollar US anti-missile system, the government confirmed on Thursday. Interceptors for the Aegis Ashore system were set to be placed in two regions under a controversial and expensive program. "The National Security Council discussed this matter and reached a conclusion that the deployment of Aegis Ashore in Akita and Yamaguchi is to be rescinded," Defense Minister Taro Kono told a meeting of his party. "I want to deeply apologize that it has come to this." The government made the decision after being put under increased pressure from local residents who were less than eager to see an anti-missile defense system built near their homes. Instead, the council plans to revise Japan's basic defense plan and update its own missile defense program later this year.

The Aegis Ashore system was approved in 2017 and was estimated to cost Japan $4.2 billion (€3.7 billion) over 30 years. There have been competing claims that this estimate may have fallen far short of the actual cost.
