German prosecutors launched an investigation on Friday into whether the suspect in the Madeleine McCann case may have been involved in a similar disappearance in Germany. The German case concerns a 5-year-old girl named Inga who disappeared while on a family trip to a forest near the eastern town of Stendal in May 2015. The suspect in the McCann case reportedly owned a property in the town of Neuwegersleben located 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Stendal when the girl disappeared.
