NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg touted the importance of German leadership, following US President Donald Trump's controversial move to announce the withdrawal of 9,500 US troops from Germany. "The world needs more German leadership," Stoltenberg told DW. "NATO needs German leadership. We all need Germany to play an even more important role because Germany is the largest economy in Europe."

Stoltenberg added that he spoke with Trump about the move prior to the official announcement, and urged him to maintain the US presence in Europe. "It's important for Europe, but it's also important for the United States," he said. "Peace and stability in Europe adds to the security of North America." The US has maintained an established military presence in Germany since the Convention on the Presence of Foreign Forces in the Federal Republic of Germany was signed in 1954. The convention allowed eight NATO members, including the US, to maintain a permanent presence.
