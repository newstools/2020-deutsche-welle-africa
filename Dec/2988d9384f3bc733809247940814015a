A convent in the northern German town of Thuine on Tuesday said that 76 of its nuns had tested positive for coronavirus. Sister Superior General of the Sisters of Saint Francis of the Martyr St. George, Maria Cordis Reiker, said a further 85 had tested negative, with more results pending. The cases so far had been mild, she said. "Nobody has had to go to the hospital, and we are grateful for that," said Reiker. The order runs several day schools and a boarding school for boys. "How things will continue with the facilities is still in flux," Reiker said. She added that the necessary steps would be discussed with the health department, which ordered a quarantine for the entire monastery grounds on Friday after the first cases became known.
