A 99-year-old Croatian woman gave a thumbs up on Thursday after beating coronavirus. "It's over, I feel fine now," Margareta Kranjcec told the Vererniji List newspaper. She tested positive for COVID-19 in late October and spent three weeks in hospital. Kranjcec is bedridden but to her age and fragility, but medics say she has no serious underlying health conditions. The nonagenarian was among 51 residents at her retirement home in Karlovac who tested positive for the virus. But Kranjcec was asymptomatic, according to the home's director Stefica Ljubic Mlinac. "With her fragility and old age it is really amazing how the coronavirus did not do her any harm," Ljubic Mlinac was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. "It's such nice news" amid the gloom of the pandemic, she added.
