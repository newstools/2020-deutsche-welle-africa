"A deep crack is running through our club," Hitzlsperger wrote in an open letter, adding that the situation "has now finally become unacceptable." Promoted Stuttgart are a heady seventh in the Bundesliga table after impressing in the first 13 games under coach Pellegrino Matarazzo. But like many German clubs, the hierarchy above the coach is quite complex. Sven Mislintat is the sporting director, with Hitzlsperger his boss as board member for sport and head of the board for the club, sometimes also called the chief executive. But Vogt is president of the supervisory board and the company's presidium which are ultimately in charge.

"It's best not to say anything," the German No. 1 said when asked what to say after such a match. He did concede though that he was angry with himself after missing umpteen winners. Despite the disappointment, Clemens did make darts history at London's Alexandra Palace, by becoming the first German to make it to the last 16 at the world championship. The match is also reported to have attracted a television audience in Germany of more than a million viewers.

A third round of negative tests led to the U-turn as local health authorities lifted the quarantine and organizers said the athletes could compete. The decision comes a day after the Poles were excluded from qualifying on Monday. Organizers have said they will be allowed extra training jumps before the start of the competition. Paris St-Germain have confirmed that German coach Thomas Tuchel has been fired following days of speculation about the move.

Chinese streaming firm Tencent has stopped broadcasting live NBA games involving the Philadelphia 76ers in an apparent protest against the club's new president, Daryl Morey, who voiced support for Hong Kong demonstrators last year.

The 39-year-old Swiss, a huge favorite with the Melbourne crowds, hadn't missed the Australian Open since his debut in 2000, winning the trophy six times. "In the end Roger ran out of time to get himself ready for the rigors of a Grand Slam and he's very disappointed he won't be coming to Melbourne in 2021," said tournament director Craig Tiley. "We wish him all the best as he prepares for his comeback later in the year and look forward to seeing him in Melbourne in 2022." This year's Australian Open is to start later than usual, on February 8, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Dawid Kubacki will be unable to defend his Four Hills title as he and the rest of the Polish team won't compete in the tournament's opener after one of their jumpers tested positive for the coronavirus. Organizers said on Monday just hours ahead of qualifying in Oberstdorf, that health authorities decided that the team including Kubacki and former two-time Four Hills winner and Olympic champion Kamil Stoch can't take part. Klemens Muranka's positive result was announced late Sunday after all jumpers and team staff underwent mandatory testing. His teammates, who all tested negative, were not allowed to jump in Oberstdorf because they were in direct contact with him. Further tests are to determine possible quarantine measures and also whether when or whether at all the Polish team can return to the prestigious event which runs until January 6. Missing one event means that none of the Poles has a chance to get the overall title because that goes to the jumper with the most points garnered in all four events.

"We need to have a good atmosphere in and around the team to be successful again. I will give everything so that we can accomplish our goals together,'' Gross said in a statement posted on Schalke's website.
