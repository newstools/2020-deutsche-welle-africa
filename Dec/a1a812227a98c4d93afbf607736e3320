"We have several injured people in the pedestrian zone, who were hit by a car. The car is secured, the driver has been detained," police initially reported. In a press conference, authorities said the driver was a 51-year-old German man, who had been detained. His car was seized by the police. Authorities asked locals to avoid the scene, while emergency services responded to the incident and carried out their investigation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert expressed shock on Twitter about the "harrowing" event in Trier. "Thoughts are with the relatives of the victims, with the injured and with everyone who is currently on duty taking care of those affected," Seibert wrote on behalf of the chancellor. Details were limited initially. The police for the state of Rhineland-Palatinate also asked the public to avoid spreading rumors about the incident. "Please do not spread speculation. Reliable information can be obtained from the staff of @PolizeiTrier," the police department tweeted. Trier police has also asked witnesses and others to please not share videos they may have captured at the scene on social media, urging them to send them directly to authorities instead. jcg/msh (Reuters, dpa)
