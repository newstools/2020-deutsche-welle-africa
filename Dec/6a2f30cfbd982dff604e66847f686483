Romania's opposition Social Democrats (PSD) party won Sunday's general election with just under 30% of votes in both houses of parliament, according to official partial results. The centrist National Liberal Party (PNL) of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban came in second, with 24.2%-24.7% of votes for the two houses. The centrist alliance USR-Plus, a likely coalition partner for the Liberals, won 15.4% of votes. "Talks to form a majority ... won't be long ... this country needs a government as soon as possible," Orban told supporters, adding that his party had four potential coalition partners to form a majority.

Over 18 million Romanians were eligible to vote, although turnout dipped to historic lows in part due to concerns over becoming infected with the coronavirus. Polling stations required voters to wear masks, maintain social distancing and sanitize their hands — but no additional virus precautions were put in place. By Sunday afternoon, only a quarter of those who were eligible to vote had cast their ballots, according to data released by Romania's Central Election Bureau. The data put voter turnout at 33%, a record low for a parliamentary election in the country. The PNL is set to fall short of a governing majority, but analysts predict that the party could try to seek a coalition including the USR-PLUS Alliance.

The Social Democrats won the previous election in 2016 by a landslide, but the party faced massive anti-corruption protests and disputes with the EU over controversial judicial reforms and graft scandals. The PNL took the reins of a rocky minority government a year ago after the Social Democrats ran through three prime ministers and dozens of minister reshuffles. rs,lc/dr (AFP, AP, Reuters)
