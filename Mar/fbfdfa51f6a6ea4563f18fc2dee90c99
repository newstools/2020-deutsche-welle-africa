German police carried out a series of raids against across the country in a crackdown against a gang of suspected Vietnamese smugglers on Tuesday. A total of 700 police took part in the operation. Berlin was the focus of the raids where police searched more than 20 apartments and business premises, including cosmetics studios and restaurants around the city's eastern Kreuzberg district. Police also carried out raids in cities in six other German states including Baden-Württemburg, Lower Saxony and Hesse. During the crackdown police issued 13 arrest warrants and took six suspects into custody. They are wanted on charges relating to the smuggling of at least 155 Vietnamese people to Germany dating back to 2018. The police took a further 30 people — seemingly trafficked individuals — into temporary custody for questioning, citing uncertainty over their residency status in Germany.
