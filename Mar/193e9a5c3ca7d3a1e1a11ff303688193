A lifetime of adventures Uderzo was born in 1927 in a city near Reims in northeastern France. The son of Italian immigrants, he already enjoyed painting as a teenager, but went on to do an apprenticeship in carpentry. After World War II, he began his career illustrating comics. He met and teamed up with Goscinny in 1952. The pair worked on other projects together before striking gold with the stories of the little village of Gauls. The comics tell of the adventures of the title character Asterix and his friend Obelix. After Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued working on the series alone, taking over the writing as well, before gradually retiring at the age of 84. He chose author Jean-Vyes Ferri and illustrator Didier Conrad to carry on the series. The duo, who took over in 2013, still write and illustrate new editions of the comic to this day. Since 1959, the "Asterix" comic books have sold 370 million copies in over 100 languages. kp/rc (AFP, dpa) DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
