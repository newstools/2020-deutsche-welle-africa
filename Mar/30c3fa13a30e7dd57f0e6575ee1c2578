The center-right Ordinary People party emerged victorious in Solvakia's general election on Saturday, with voters responding to the party's pledge to push anti-corruption reform following the death of murdered journalist Jan Kuciak. According to final results released Sunday by the Statistics Office, the Ordinary People group secured 25% of Saturday's vote and 53 seats in the 150-seat parliament. The governing center-left Smer-Social Democracy party, led by former populist Prime Minister Robert Fico, won 18.3%, or 38 seats. The discourse during these elections was dominated by the 2018 double murder of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Kusnirova. Kuciak has reported on high-level corruption within the government. The murder led to nationwide street protests, forcing Fico to resign. However, the Smer coalition remained in power, under the leadership of Peter Pellegrini.
