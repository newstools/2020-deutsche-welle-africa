Tuberculosis kills more people than any other infectious disease, according to information shared by the United Nations (UN) on Tuesday. Around 1.5 million people died from the bacterial infection in 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported, bringing attention to World Tuberculosis Day on March 24. Approximately 10 million people are infected with tuberculosis every year, the WHO said on its website. Only a small portion of global cases receive the necessary life-saving medicine. Over 4,000 people die of tuberculosis every day.

Tuberculosis is a disease affecting primarily the lungs. "For millions of people with tuberculosis, the coronavirus represents a significant danger because their lungs are already weakened by tuberculosis, their general health is low due poverty, and they don’t have access to adequate healthcare," Burkard Kömm, director of the agency German Leprosy and Tuberculosis Relief (DAHW) told German news agency EPD.

Tuberculosis can be cured if treated over six months with a cocktail of four different antibiotics, DAWH said. However, many patients end their treatment early or develop a resistance to the medication that complicates and prolongs treatment. A lack of medicine is a common reason why patients end their treatment early, DAWH said. kp/rg (EPD, dpa) Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2uimV DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
