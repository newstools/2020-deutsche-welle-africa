A Houthi leader in Yemen on Wednesday "welcomed" an announcement by the Saudi-led coalition to support a ceasefire amid the coronavirus pandemic. Mohammed Ali al-Houthi said in a tweet that they are waiting for the ceasefire to be applied practically. Earlier in the day, the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen extended its support to the Yemeni government, after it accepted the United Nations Secretary-General's call for a ceasefire to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak. Saudi coalition spokesperson Colonel Turki al-Malki said that they support the UN call for a ceasefire and de-escalation. He added that the coalition also backs the steps being taken to come up with confidence-building measures on the humanitarian and economic fronts.
