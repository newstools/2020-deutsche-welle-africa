Members of the American women's soccer team wore their warm-up jerseys inside-out, hiding the US Soccer Federation (USSF) logo, as they stepped out for their match against Japan on Wednesday night.

"I sincerely apologize for the offense and pain caused by language in this week's court filing, which did not reflect the values of our federation,” he said in a statement amid rising criticism.
