The song was the B-side of Hymne de la 8e Coupe d'Afrique des Nations, a song that celebrated the Cameroon national football team's appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations football tournament. "Soul Makossa" was later picked up and popularized by New York DJs. A virtuoso on the saxophone, vibraphone and piano, Dibango was a regular in Germany and last performed at the Africa WÃ¼rzburg Festival in 2018. In 2009, he accused Michael Jackson of borrowing one of his hooks for two songs on the legendary Thriller album. Jackson settled out of court. Dibango was outspoken in the fight against music pirating on his home continent, especially since many African musicians have been denied royalties. "That is a big problem for artists," the saxophonist told DW in 2018. "At some point, someone will have to pay. Who is paying the price? Right now it's the artists." sb/rf (AFP, Reuters)
