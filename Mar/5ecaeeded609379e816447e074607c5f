Treason usually means a sentence of at least 15 years in Germany, but the judges took into account that both defendants had confessed to their crimes and had no previous convictions, the court said. The trial was closed to the public in order to protect state secrets. What did Abdul S do? Kabul-born Abdul S. met with Iranian intelligence contacts in different European cities on several occasions between 2013 and 2017 while working as a civilian translator and adviser to the German Bundeswehr in the town of Daun, near Koblenz. He sold information to Iran, including "German army maps about military situations" and "defense ministry analyses of particular countries and topics" in exchange for around €34,500 euros ($37,000). Abdul S. was unable to explain to the court what prompted him to begin selling state secrets. He was arrested in 2019 and has been held in pre-trial custody up until his trial began in January this year. The court's ruling in not yet final, meaning it could be appealed. kmm/rc (Reuters, dpa)Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
