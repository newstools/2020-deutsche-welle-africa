Researchers in Germany could begin mass testing for immunity against the novel coronavirus as early as April, Der Spiegel reported on Friday. The respected weekly news magazine said the test results would show how many people have been infected and developed antibodies — the body's "memory" about how to fight a virus  —  as well as more accurate data about how many people have been killed out of all those infected.

If researchers get the go-ahead from government health authorities, they would conduct the first tests using blood samples from 100,000 people with tests then repeated periodically. The first results could be back by the end of next month. Immunity certificates Scientists believe that the results of the study could make it easier to decide when schools can be re-opened, larger events can go ahead and people can go back to work.

But there are still some problems with the Sars-Cov-2 antibody test as it still occasionally shows up other coronaviruses – which 90% of adults are already immune to. Scientists are looking into developing a more reliable test within two to three months.
