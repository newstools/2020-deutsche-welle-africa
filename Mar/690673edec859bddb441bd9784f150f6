The German government's anti-Semitism commissioner, Felix Klein, has dubbed a planned lecture on Adolf Hitler's lover Eva Braun as "completely incomprehensible and ahistorical," according to the Sunday edition of Bild newspaper. The lecture was expected to be given at the Technical University of Braunschweig (TU) as part of a series about women in world history. TU, however, rejected the accusation that the university was advancing Nazi ideas. "In conclusion, this is a contribution against right-wing extremist legends," it said in a statement.

I, the mistress of the greatest man in Germany and on Earth ... Comments on Eva Braun.'" The lecture was ultimately canceled due to illness on the part of the lecturer. The university is also considering how the researcher behind the lecture could manage to explain his role in the event, "namely to critically reflect on why a historically insignificant woman like Eva Braun still receives a lot of media attention to this day."
