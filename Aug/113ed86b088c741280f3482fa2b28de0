Hong Kong residents on Tuesday lined up to buy the Apple Daily in a show of support for its owner, Jimmy Lai, who was arrested the day before under a new national security law imposed by Beijing. The newspaper, which is often critical of the Beijing leadership, said it had printed 500,000 copies, five times as many as normal. The Tuesday edition showed a picture of Lai being led away in handcuffs with a headline saying "Apple will fight on."
