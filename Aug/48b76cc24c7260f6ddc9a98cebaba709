At least one person was confirmed dead and several others were injured after a five-story apartment building collapsed in the town of Mahad in Raigad district, 160 kilometers (99 miles) south of Mumbai, the police said in a statement Monday. The building, named Tarique Garden, comprised 47 flats, Maharashtra state police said. India's National Disaster Response Force sent rescue crews and canine teams to the site of the accident. Rescue operations are expected to continue throughout the night. Around 25 people have been rescued, but it is still not clear how many more remain trapped under the debris. "Initially the top three floors of the building collapsed when some people came out. We have been able to bring out 15 persons. The injured have been sent to a government hospital," Nidhi Choudhari, the District Collector told the Hindustan Times newspaper. Dozens of people were believed to be trapped under the rubble There were fewer people in the building since Monday was a working day, Choudhari said. Architect to face charges The district administration has filed charges against the builder, the architect, and the contractor late Monday. Uddhav Thackery, chief minister of Maharashtra state, where Mahad is located, gave local authorities his assurance of support for speedy rescue and relief work in a statement on Twitter. The cause of the collapse was not entirely clear. Such incidents are not uncommon in India, particularly during the monsoon season, when rainy conditions make buildings with shoddy construction more vulnerable. Earlier this month, a crane collapse at an Indian shipyard killed at least 11 workers. More than 1,200 deaths worldwide have been attributed to monsoon-related disasters this year, including 800 in India.
