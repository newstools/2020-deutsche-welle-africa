France will increase its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Wednesday. Macron asked Turkey to cease oil and gas exploration in contested waters that has spurred tensions with Greece. A statement by Macron's office said that France will "temporarily reinforce" the presence of its military to "monitor the situation in the region and mark its determination to uphold international law." In a call with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Macron raised concern over  "unilateral" exploration by Turkey, adding that they should "cease in order to allow a peaceful dialogue" between Turkey and Greece.
