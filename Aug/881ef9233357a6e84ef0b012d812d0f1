Dutch police said on Tuesday they dismantled what they described as the largest cocaine laboratory in the Netherlands. The lab was located in a former riding school in Nijveen, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Amsterdam. Police said they found tens of thousands of liters worth of chemicals and 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of the narcotic.

The operation was a "drug laundry," in which drugs were "washed out" of clothes, according to police. Drugs were dissolved in a solution that was then embedded in the clothing before being smuggled into the Netherlands. The lab in Nijveen then used special chemicals to extract the drugs before prepping it for sale. The Netherlands is seen as a major drug entry point for Europe. The country has battled drug crime, particularly cocaine smuggling, mainly through the seaport of Rotterdam, the largest on the continent. dv /dj (AFP, AP, dpa)
