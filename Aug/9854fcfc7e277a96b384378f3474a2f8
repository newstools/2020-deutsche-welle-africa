Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai was released on bail in the early hours of Wednesday morning (local time) nearly two days after his arrest under the city's new security law. Lai, founder of media company Next Digital and the Apple Daily tabloid newspaper it publishes, was swarmed by dozens supporters as he left a police station. Some held up copies of the newspaper and shouted "support Apple Daily until the end."

The law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. China imposed the law after a year of protests against Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city.
