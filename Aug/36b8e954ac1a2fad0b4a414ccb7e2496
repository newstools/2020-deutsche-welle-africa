Latest moves Germany's transfer window is open between July 15 and August 5. Click here for all the confirmed Bundesliga transfers in July. Rumor: Jadon Sancho – Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United Jadon Sancho boarded Borussia Dortmund's flight to their Switzerland training camp on Monday morning as the German club's internal deadline for a transfer seemingly expired. However, reports in England suggest that Manchester United always considered the August 10 deadline to be "artificial" and that the record English champions are still confident of signing the winger – just not for the €120m BVB are asking for. German media report that Sancho has been offered a pay-rise to stay in Dortmund, taking his salary from €6m to €10m a year, with Dortmund still confident they can cash in next summer, before the player's contract runs out in 2022. But speculation remains that they would still accept €120m this summer should United stump up the money by October. Rumor: Weston McKennie – Schalke to Hertha There is reportedly interest in Schalke's American international Weston McKennie from France, England and from within Germany – and it's Hertha Berlin who are leading the race, according to reports in Germany. Backed by investor Lars Windhorst, the Berliners are prepared and able to pay Schalke's €25m ($29m) asking price and meet McKennie's wage demands – figures which are said to have surprised even Premier League side Southampton. Reports in France suggest Ligue 1 side Monaco are also interested in the 21-year-old, but the Principality club are yet to make an offer. Rumor: Jadon Sancho – Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United The saga of the summer drags on. German media are reporting that Manchester United have agreed personal terms with Jadon Sancho but are unwilling to meet Borussia Dortmund's €120m ($141m) asking price for the English teenager, especially given the current crisis. Dortmund continue to insist that they want to keep Sancho, who has a contract until 2022, and are prepared to offer him a pay rise. But they also know that his value will drop next summer, and  won't want to keep an unhappy player. Sancho was spotted with friends in London this weekend, ahead of Dortmund's training camp in Switzerland, which begins on Monday. Rumor: Tahith Chong – Manchester United to Werder Bremen Werder Bremen sporting director Frank Baumann has confirmed that the Bundesliga side have been conducting "good talks" with Manchester United regarding a potential two-year loan move for Dutch youngster Tahith Chong. The 20-year-old, who has made 16 first team appearances for United, including in the famous Champions League comeback against Paris Saint-Germain last season, only signed a contract extension in March, but is looking for more regular game time. Bremen see the pacey winger as a potential replacement for Milot Rashica. Rumor: Kai Havertz – Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea The latest development in the ongoing transfer saga has seen sporting director Rudi Völler open up to Gazzetta dello Sport: "We know Chelsea have a lot of interest in him. If Chelsea want to sign Kai then they have to pay the price we’re demanding. There will be no COVID-19 discount." Rumor: Ron-Robert Zieler – Hannover to Cologne Sporting director Horst Heldt has confirmed the Billy Goats are "testing the market" and interested in signing 31-year-old Ron-Robert Zieler to provide competition for Timo Horn.

Done deal: Sarpreet Singh – Bayern Munich to Nuremberg Having already signed goalkeeper Christian Früchtl, Nuremberg have snapped up another Bayern youngster on loan in Sarpreet Singh. The New Zealand international, who has stated his desire "to take the next step" with Der Club, scored seven goals in 22 games for Bayern’s second team in the third division last season. Done deal: Max Kruse — Fenerbahce to Union Berlin The former Germany international is returning to the Bundesliga after spending last season with Istanbul-based side Fenerbahce, recording seven goals and eight assists in 21 games. Kruse was linked with Werder Bremen, where he spent three seasons before moving to Turkey, but decided instead to move to the German capital. He was a free agent after unilaterally terminating his contract with Fenerbahce, which was set to expire in 2022. The Turkish club said it would take legal action against Kruse over the contract cancellation. Rumor: Javi Martinez — Bayern Munich to Stade Rennes According to Kicker, Rennes are keen on recruiting the 31-year-old defensive specialist. Martinez has made just 10 starts this season for Bayern, the last of which came in the Bundesliga after the Bavarians clinched the league title. A factor that could work in Rennes' favor is that the French side qualified for next season's Champions League after finishing third in Ligue 1. Rumor: Sven Ulreich — Bayern Munich to Schalke With Alexander Nübel officially moving to Bayern, Ulreich may be headed the other way to Schalke. According to Kicker, the Royal Blues are among the teams interested in the 32-year-old. Ulreich has also drawn interest abroad, the German magazine said, with offers from England and Spain.

Done deal: Lucas Torro — Eintracht Frankfurt to Osasuna The former Real Madrid academy product is returning to Spain after two seasons in Germany's financial capital. Torro made just 25 appearances in those two seasons, including 12 in 2019-20. Done deal: Fin Bartels — Werder Bremen to Holstein Kiel Bremen has parted ways with versatile forward Bartels as they continue to restructure their roster after surviving relegation.
