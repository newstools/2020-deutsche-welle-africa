"The international alliance forces today handed over site Number 8 at Camp Taji to the Iraqi troops," a spokesman for Iraq's military Joint Operations Command, Tahsin al-Khafaji, told Iraq's state news agency INA on Sunday. The military base was used by US, Australian and New Zealand forces to train Iraqi soldiers. "Other sites in the camp will be handed over according to a timetable," al-Khafaji added without providing more details. Historically, the site housed up to 2,000 coalition members, most of whom have departed in recent months. Remaining troops will leave in the coming days after handing over the equipment to Iraqi security forces. It was the eighth transfer of a part of an Iraqi base to Iraqi forces in the past months.
