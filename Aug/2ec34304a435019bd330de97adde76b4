The UN Security Council on Friday rejected the United States' calls for an indefinite extension to the arms embargo on Iran. Shortly after the result of the council's vote was announced, China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said the outcome "once again shows that unilateralism receives no support, and bullying will fail." However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the rebuff, saying in a statement: "The Security Council's failure to act decisively in defense of international peace and security is inexcusable." The US-sponsored resolution was opposed by China and Russia. Eleven members abstained, including Germany, France and Britain, while the US and the Dominican Republic were the only members to back the proposal. To get approval, the resolution needed nine "yes" votes.
