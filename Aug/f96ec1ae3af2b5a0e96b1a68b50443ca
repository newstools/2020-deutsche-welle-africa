US President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the United Arab Emirates and Israel have agreed to establish full diplomatic ties in order to halt the annexation of occupied land sought by the Palestinians for their future state. A tweet from the White House said: "President Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed—Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the United Arab Emirates—spoke today and agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the UAE." Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador in Washington, described the accord as a "great day for peace," before adding, "Israel deeply appreciates all President Trump has done to make this breakthrough possible." jsi/dj (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters) More to come...
