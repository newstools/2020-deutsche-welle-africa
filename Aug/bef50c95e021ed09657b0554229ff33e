James Murdoch, son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, has resigned from the board of news publisher News Corp citing disagreements over the editorial content of its newspapers, which includes the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post among others. "My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions," Murdoch said in a letter sent to the board on Friday. James' more conservative brother Lachlan Murdoch is the heir apparent to Rupert Murdoch and is co-chairman of News Corp, which the family controls through 39% of the voting shares. Lachlan is also the executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation which owns the right-wing US network Fox News.
