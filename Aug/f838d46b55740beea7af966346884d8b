Wearing masks alone is not enough to preven the spread of coronavirus, the technical lead of the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency program has said, adding that people need to maintain a safe distance from others. "We are seeing that people aren't really adhering to the physical distancing anymore," said Maria Van Kerkhove at a WHO press conference.
