A revolver-wielding man, who held six people hostage at a bank in the French port city of Le Havre, surrendered after an hours-long standoff with the police, authorities said on Thursday. The incident began shortly after 17:00 local time (15:00 UTC). Local law enforcement then blocked off the surrounding area. The man released at least two of the hostages, who were not injured, police said. A third person was also released or had escaped, while the remaining three were released shortly before the man surrendered to authorities. The Le Havre police union said that no weapons were involved in the suspect's capture.
