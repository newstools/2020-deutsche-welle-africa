Organizers of the coronavirus skeptics' demonstrations set to take place this weekend expected more than 22,000 people to descend on Berlin, with bus trips organized from around the country. On Wednesday, however, the capital's authorities had called the whole thing off. Andreas Geisel, the interior minister for the city-state of Berlin, had argued the controversial decision was prompted by behavior at a previous protest on August 1, during which demonstrators "deliberately" violated hygienic and distancing rules. Many participants refused to wear face masks and maintain social distance from one another.

According to the city's authorities, thousands of planned rallies have been registered. Supporters have been using social media to encourage people to travel en masse to the capital.

"The general observation seems to be that people are still planning on coming to Berlin. There are also growing calls to use violence," Holnburger told DW. Police are preparing themselves after far-right and other activists called for people to "storm Berlin" Organizers calling themselves "Querdenker 711" ("Lateral thinkers 711") are indeed adamant that the protests will go ahead. The Stuttgart-based group is calling for the immediate removal of the German government and the termination of all coronavirus protection measures. Right-wing extremists in particular are calling for protesters to "storm Berlin." A hashtag by the same name, #SturmaufBerlin, was trending on Twitter throughout Thursday. Opponents of the demo quickly hijacked the hashtag, however, and began posting it with photos of cake. Previous demonstrations have attracted an extreme mix of critics, including COVID-19 deniers, anti-vaxxers, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) politicians, conspiracy theorists, and several groups from the far-right extremist scene.

Jürgen Elsässer from the right-wing extremist "Compact" magazine said he considers Saturday the "most important day since 1945," referring to Germany's watershed moment — the end of WW2. The controversial move to ban the demonstration had been largely supported by Berlin politicians. Members of the far-right AfD, however, called on people to mobilize. They said the decision to ban the protest showed how the Berlin Senate is "trampling on basic rights," said regional AfD leader in Berlin Nicolaus Fest. Protesters are camped out behind banners demanding German politicians be 'locked away' Political scientist Jasmin Riedel says the decision to ban could be seen from two perspectives: legally and politically.

As that was not the case at the August 1 protest, Berlin state authorities came to the conclusion that coronavirus prevention measures would not be upheld at this weekend's demo. From the political perspective, however, Riedl said it was "extremely clumsy" of Berlin's interior senator Geisel to add that he didn't want Berlin to be used as a 'backdrop for coronavirus deniers, Reichsbürger and right-wing extremists.' "In doing so, he "gifted the protesters an extra line of argument," Riedl said.
