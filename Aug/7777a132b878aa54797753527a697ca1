Here is the latest coronavirus news from around the globe: The US economy has been hard-hit by the pandemic, with many businesses filing for bankruptcy The United States has reported a total of 5 million confirmed coronavirus cases, according to a Reuters tally on Saturday. Just hours earlier, President Donald Trump signed executive orders on the partial restoration of unemployment payments, as Congress remains deadlocked over a stimulus package that would extend economic aid. "This is the money they need, this is the money they want, this gives them an incentive to go back to work," Trump said, signing an executive order that will provide an extra $400 per week in unemployment payments. The new number is lower than the $600 per week that was passed during the initial stage of the pandemic. Trump also signed orders providing eviction protection and student loan repayment relief, as well as one suspending payroll taxes for people earning less than $100,000 (€85,000) per year.

But Brazil is under collective amnesia." The ministry said there were 100,477 deaths and more than 3 million confirmed cases, making it the second-hardest hit country in the world after the United States.

While Africa has just over 1 million confirmed infections, experts say that the number could be several times higher.
