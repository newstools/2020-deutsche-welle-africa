Austria's foreign ministry on Monday said the country will expel a Russian diplomat for violating privileges and immunities. "His behavior is not in accordance with the Vienna Convention," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said without elaborating. The Russian diplomat must leave the country by September 1, Austrian media reported. In a response on Twitter, the Russian embassy said, "We are outraged by the unfounded decision of the Austrian authorities, which is damaging to constructive relations." Later, Russia's Foreign Ministry said that it had declared an Austrian diplomat persona non grata after summoning the ambassador, citing the decision in Vienna. According to Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung, the diplomat had engaged in economic espionage.
