Young people were hardest hit by the economic impact of coronavirus, according to a study published on Sunday for the German Medicines Manufacturers' Association (BAH). Those aged 18 to 29 were the worst affected, the study said, with 50% of respondents in that age bracket saying they had suffered a loss of income as a result of the pandemic. Money problems were still pronounced for those in their 30s, with 38% of those surveyed having felt the financial pinch. Only a small minority of older respondents said they had suffered economically, the study found. Only 15% of over-60s said they had been negatively impacted, with the rest reporting no difference. Overall, almost a third of those surveyed across all ages said there had been a noticeable effect on their income or that of a partner. Almost all the rest said there were no negative consequences for them.
