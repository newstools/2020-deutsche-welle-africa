Hamilton, who had not topped any of the three practice sessions nor the first two parts of qualifying during which he even spun, was there when it mattered with a Silverstone record time of 1 minute 24.303 seconds. It's his 91st career pole and third of the season. Bottas trailed by a massive three-tenths of a second and Max Verstappen was a distant third for Red Bull, more than a second behind Hamilton. The grid Quote of the day Max Verstappen. “Mercedes was just way too fast. You try to do the best you can and I did that. From third, you have a fighting chance."
