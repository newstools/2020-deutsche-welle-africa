A recent update to technology export rules in China could give Beijing the final say on whether the forced sale of video-sharing app TikTok's US business will be approved, a Chinese trade expert told state media late Saturday. On Friday, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced it had added 23 items to a list of technologies that are banned or restricted for export. It was the first revision to the list in 12 years.

These new categories would apply to TikTok and to technologies held by ByteDance, the app's Beijing-based parent company, Professor Cui Fan of China's University of International Business and Economics said in an interview with the state-run Xinhua news agency published late Saturday. "If ByteDance plans to export-related technologies, it should go through the licensing procedures," Cui said in an interview with Xinhua published on Saturday. Preliminary approval to export the technology can take up to 30 days.

"Therefore, it is recommended that ByteDance seriously studies the adjusted catalog and carefully considers whether it is necessary to suspend" negotiations on a sale, he said.

China's foreign ministry has also condemned the order, saying Beijing will defend the rights and interests of Chinese businesses. kp/mm (dpa, Reuters) Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3haKv
