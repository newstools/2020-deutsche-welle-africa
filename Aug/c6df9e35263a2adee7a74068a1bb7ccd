At least two German soldiers are being investigated for allegedly breaching air traffic laws after they delivered flowers to a fiancee using an army helicopter, a police spokesperson said on Friday. The Bundeswehr (German military) personnel flew over the village of Arnsberg-Holzen in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and dropped a white package that was collected by a woman and reportedly contained a bouquet of flowers, local media reported. "The precise circumstances are still under examination," police said, adding that investigations were directed against at least two members of the armed forces – a 44-year-old local man and the pilot. Authorities are also investigating how a military helicopter stationed in Nörvenich, near Cologne, had been used for personal purposes.
