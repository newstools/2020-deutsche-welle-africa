The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, will make his first trip to Tehran as head of the UN's nuclear watchdog on Monday, in an attempt to put pressure on Iran to allow inspectors to visit two key sites, he announced on Saturday. The IAEA board passed a resolution in June to amp up the pressure on the country with regards to suspicions over two sites that are suspected of potentially still containing undeclared nuclear material. 'Outstanding questions' Grossi declared the objective of the trip is "that my meetings in Tehran will lead to concrete progress in addressing the outstanding questions that the Agency has related to safeguards in Iran and, in particular, to resolve the issue of access."
