The number of people between 15 and 24 years old in Germany continues to sink, with just 8.5 million in this age group living in the country at the end of 2019, figures released by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) showed on Tuesday. That makes up just 10.3% percent of Germany's population of 83.2 million people, Destatis said. Fifteen years ago, it said, there were 9.7 million people in the 15-24 age group, making up 11.8% of the population. It said both the absolute number and the percentage had dropped continually since 2005, with the exception of 2015, despite a constant growth in Germany's population since 2011, partly due to immigration.
