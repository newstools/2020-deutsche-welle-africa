Joe Biden formally accepted the US Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday on the final day of the party's convention. The 77-year-old former vice president called for unity in his speech, which closed the four-day convention. "I want to be America's president," he stated in an impassioned speech, saying he would represent all people, not just those who voted for him. He described the election as a "battle for America's souls" and vowed to end "this season of darkness for America." "The days of the US cozying up to dictators are over," he added. He also vowed that his first priority as president would be "dealing with this coronavirus." "The tragedy of this virus is that it could have been avoided," Biden said. He implied mandatory mask-wearing would be brought in at a federal level under his presidency. The convention was held online owing to the pandemic which has claimed over 170,000 lives in the US. Former presidential nominee hopeful Kamala Harris made history on Wednesday when she accepted the nomination to be vice president.
