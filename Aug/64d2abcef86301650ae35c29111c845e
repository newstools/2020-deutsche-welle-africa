A pair of Michael Jordan's game-worn sneakers sold for $615,000 (€520,000), Christie's auction house announced, breaking the previous record set just months ago by another pair of the basketball legend's shoes. Jordan wore the red-and-black Air Jordan 1 Highs during a 1985 exhibition match in Italy when he dunked the ball so hard it shattered the glass backboard. "This is the original shoe with an actual piece of the backboard, a piece of glass, in the sole of the shoe," said Caitlin Donovan, head of handbag and sneaker sales at Christie's – the famous auction house that organized the auction with Stadium Goods. Overall, Jordan racked up 30 points while wearing the size 13.5 shoes.

He played in the NBA all-star game 19 times. Karl "The Mailman" Malone played 18 seasons for the Utah Jazz before finishing his career with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2004.

(*as of March 19, 2019) Michael "Air" Jordan was picked third overall by the Chicago Bulls in the 1984 NBA draft. He would have scored many more points had he not interrupted his career with two retirements; in 1993 and 1999. During his first retirement from basketball, during which his No. 23 was retired by the Chicago Bulls, Jordan played minor league baseball. He ended his career with the Washington Wizards in 2003. Who would have thought that a kid from Germany's second division would make it to the NBA, let alone become a superstar?

They immediately traded him to Dallas, where he has spent his entire NBA career, becoming the MVP in 2007. (*as of March 18, 2019) Wilt Chamberlain played 14 seasons in the NBA, turning out for the Philadelphia / San Francisco Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Los Angeles Lakers.

The center was drafted No. 1 overall by the Orlando Magic and went on to play for them and five other teams over a 19-year career. In 2000 Shaq became one of just three players to win the awards as NBA MVP, All-Star game MVP and Finals MVP in the same year. In 1974 Moses Malone became the first player to make it to the NBA out of high school. The center had his best years with the Philadelphia 76ers, where he won his only NBA title. Malone played for nine teams in a career that lasted 21 season. He was the NBA's MVP three times and was 12 times an NBA All-Star.

He is fourth in rebounds in NBA history - behind Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

But the most recent auction for another pair of Jordan's worn footwear landed below the estimated range of $650,000 and $850,000. The National Basketball Association (NBA) describes Jordan, who retired in 2003, as "the greatest basketball player of all time." The market value of objects associated with the star have soared since the release of "The Last Dance," an ESPN/Netflix documentary about Jordan and his time playing for the Chicago Red Bulls.
