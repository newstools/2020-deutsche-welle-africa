French President Emmanuel Macron has denounced the "unspeakable" defacing of a Nazi massacre memorial, adding that everything would be done to find the people behind the act. The main entrance sign for the memorial at Oradour-sur-Glane in central France was vandalized with the word "martyr" crossed out with white paint. Slogans denying the massacre and the word "menteur" or "liar" had also been added to the sign. The graffiti was discovered when the memorial center opened on Friday morning, according to its president, Fabrice Escure.
